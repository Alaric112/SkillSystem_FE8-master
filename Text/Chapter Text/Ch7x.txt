Kairs...I wanted to thank you[N]

Lena and the Elder along with[N]
the castle's guard were captured[AN]
I think they were taken[N]
back to the castle[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]

one more reason[N]
to move[AN]
[OpenMidRight]

soon as possible,[AN]

Nausica[aa] I need to talk to you,[N]
when you have a moment[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Even now for me[AN]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidRight][LoadGadriel][OpenMidRight]
Nausica[aa]![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Gadriel? Tell me[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Since you’re creating an army to[N]
free Sorya and your people[AN]
Let me be your guard![AN]
The enemy will aim at you...and[N]
I want my sword at your side![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Um...thank you Gadriel...but...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Is something wrong?[AN]
I just don’t like the fact[N]
that you’re my "guard"[AN]
I don’t want you to feel obligated to[N]
sacrifice your life to defend my[AN]
But, I would fight for you even[N]
at the cost of my life![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don’t want that...[AN]
I’m not asking to anyone,[N]
Gadriel...[AN]
I’m just fighting for free my lands...[N]
too many people have already died...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I just wish you had someone[N]
ready to give their all[AN]
as you would do for your people[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Gadriel...thanks for your friendship,[N]
but you don’t need to[AN]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidRight][LoadCalliope][OpenMidRight]
Nausica[aa], I was thinking,[N]
as your advisor...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Wait a minute! since you[N]
were named my "advisor"?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Don’t tell me you don’t want[N]
me as your advisor!?![AN]
it would be a serious offense to me![AN]
since I am your friend[N]
from childhood![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Calliope, anyone with an idea or a[N]
plan to propose is welcome...[AN]
there is no need for a "counselor"[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh my, but it would be[N]
much nicer...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
The situation is not to be taken[AN]
lightly as if it was a joke[N]
[OpenMidRight]
You’re right, I was just trying[N]
to lighten the mood...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Come on! Try to be positive! Let’s[N]
think about when it’s all over[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I can’t think about the future...[N]
while we’re here fighting...[AN]
there’s too much at stake...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
It’s not easy I know, but we[N]
can’t bark in spirit,[AN]
you said it yourself to me long ago[AN]
Well...that’s my advice...remember[N]
you can count on me.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
I don’t know what scares me the most...[N]
the present or the future...[A][X]

## LukasSupportManfredTextC
[OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred][OpenMidRight][LoadLukas][OpenMidRight]
C-Captain?, Captain!!![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lukas, boy, have you decided[N]
to join this army?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes captain, I’m here to redeem the[N]
name of the empire,[AN] 
the name of the knights' order[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You’re just a boy[AN]
a young soldier, you do not have to[N]
take charge of these things[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
No captain! I want to be[N]
a great knight, like you![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
You have a noble heart[N]
as a true knight,[AN]
it is a pity that you[N]
are only a squire[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
I am also happy to be a simple soldier[AN]
if it means being at your[N]
side, my Captain[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
Boy, take this spear...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Captain? Why are you giving[N]
me this spear?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
is a ceremonial spear[AN]
is given to the young[N]
knights of the empire[AN]
who are preparing to leave[N]
for a great enterprise[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I...I cannot accept this gift...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
and why? doing so[N]
offends me boy[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I’m not a knight[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You are in your heart, and it’s[N]
the most important thing[AN]
that’s why you deserve it.[AN]
It is not the title or his armor[N]
that makes a knight,[AN]
but his deeds, remember this Lukas[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
Captain...thank you...[A][X]

## DianaSupportRosieTextC
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDiana][OpenMidRight][LoadRosie][OpenMidLeft]
Rosie, I wanted to talk to[N]
you about something...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Diana?[AN]
What are you afraid of? You know[N]
you can talk to me freely![AN]
Is someone bothering you?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh, I suspected it![AN]
Well, tell me who it is so[N]
I’ll teach him a lesson![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
That’s what I wanted to[N]
talk to you about...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Uhm...?[AN]
Diana, what do you mean?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ever since we confronted[N]
the bandits...[AN]
I’ve noticed a change[N]
in your behavior...[AN]
You seem a lot more aggressive...[AN]
and the thing that scares me the most[N]
is that in battle...you feel no pity[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Mercy? Why would I show[N]
mercy to monsters?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Those are not monsters![AN]
[CloseEyes]
I don’t know why you keep saying this![AN]
[OpenEyes]
I...I can’t go on anymore...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Diana, you’re just scared,[N]
and I get it,[AN]
anyone in this situation[N]
would be scared...[AN]
The problem is you keep thinking[N]
that we fight people,[AN]
while those are just beasts with[N]
 the aim of killing you,[AN]
if you do not free the mind, you[N]
will facilitate their work...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You’re right, I’m just scared...[AN]
But the thing that scares me the most[N]
is not the battle...but you Rosie...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
One day you’ll understand...[A][X]
