Kairs...I wanted to thank you[N]
for helping my people[AN]
Do you know where my sister is?[AN]
She must be very[N]
scared...[AN]
I want to say goodbye before[N]
the our departure[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I tried to do everything[N]
I could do...[AN]
But...Nausica[aa]...Lena[N]
isn't here[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Lena and the Elder along with[N]
the castle's guard were captured[AN]
I think they were taken[N]
back to the castle[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
... ... ...[AN]
one more reason[N]
to move[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I agree, we must prepare as[N]
soon as possible,[AN]
Captain Manfred has already started,[AN]
I suggest you go and talk to him[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidRight][LoadCatherina][OpenMidRight]
Nausica[aa] I need to talk to you,[N]
when you have a moment...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Even now for me[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, I wanted to warn you that[AN]
Slayder’s forces are allied[N]
with someone else...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
How do you know? and who[N]
might be helping him?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
wormhandlers...contemptible[N]
people of the wild lands...[N]
you have to be careful...[AN]
for a bit of gold and freedom...[N]
they would do anything[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I see...but...[AN]
How did you recognize them?[N]
How can you be so sure?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Nausica[aa]...[AN]
only the people of sin wear garments[N]
made with the slug worms[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don’t think that’s a good reason...[AN]
then why did you call them[N]
people of the sin?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
because they are the closest[N]
descendants to the fallen angels[AN]
therefore they are a manifestation[N]
of the evil of this world...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
There are many things we don't[N]
understand about our world[AN]
and judge an entire people for[N]
ancient stories...it seems to me...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Nausica[aa], I've seen their madness[AN]
I'm just asking you to be careful...[AN]
our next opponents will be formidable[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
... ... ...[AN]
I agree, better be careful...[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadAsbel][OpenMidRight][LoadCatherina][OpenMidLeft]
Sis![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Asbel? why do you have[N]
this worried face?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm worried about you![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Why? we are together again![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
For now...but how long[N] 
will it last?[AN]
When this is over, will you[N]
go back to Alistar?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
The republic is our home, if you're[N]
worried about the senator...I...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don't care about the senators[N]
and their political games[AN]
Alistar is not our home! we are[N]
the last members of Pejite![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Pejite is a colony[N]
of Alistar, so...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
No! no![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
Alistar has given us a[N]
home, a future...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
why do you reject it? why did you[N]
complicate everything years ago?!![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
My worries were well founded...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
you have completely forgotten what[N]
blood runs in your veins...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Brother, please...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I've made my decision...my days[N]
as an Alistar slave are over[AN]
After defeating the empire, our[N]
paths will separate![AN]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Asbel...why do you accept[N]
the blood of sin?[AN]
Alistar gave us the possibility[N]
of redemption...why Asbel, why?[A][X]

we have just finished downloading[N]
some of the resources provided[AN]
by her highness...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Hope that's enough...I heard Captain[N]
Zek sided with the deserters[AN]
he is a valiant knight, and[N]
an excellent strategist...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
True, but with us we have the[N]
strength of Captain Manfred![AN]
he is a hero of the civil war[N]
of laurentia years ago![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
If I remember correctly, Zek also[N]
fought in that war...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Yeah! They were under the direct[N]
command of General Yupa![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
The only survivors of those days[AN]
the whole company together[N]
with the general died...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
What a tragedy... two old comrades[N]
in arms who are now fighting...[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBart][OpenMidRight][LoadNausicaa]
Oh! oh! So the little girl made it![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Bart![AN]
I'm happy to see you[N]
all in one piece[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Not really, unfortunately I have a[N]
bad wound on my right leg[AN]
If it wasn’t for that, I would have[N]
joined your gang to kick some ass[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh I’m sorry, I hope you’ll be back[N]
in time for when I’m done[AN]
So you can offer everyone a drink[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I love doing business with you![AN]
but wait, don't think[N]
I can't help you![AN]
I've got a couple more ammo ready[N]
for your special lance![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Fantastic! thank you very much Bart[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
No need to thank as long as you use[N]
it to chase away those cursed ones![A][X]

## GadrielSupportNausicaaTextC
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidRight][LoadGadriel][OpenMidRight]
Nausica[aa]![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Gadriel? Tell me[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Since you’re creating an army to[N]
free Sorya and your people[AN]
Let me be your guard![AN]
The enemy will aim at you...and[N]
I want my sword at your side![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Um...thank you Gadriel...but...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Is something wrong?[AN]
I just don’t like the fact[N]
that you’re my guard[AN]
I don’t want you to feel obligated to[N]
sacrifice your life to defend my[AN]
But, I would fight for you even[N]
at the cost of my life![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don’t want that...[AN]
I’m not asking to anyone,[N]
Gadriel...[AN]
I’m just fighting for free my lands...[N]
too many people have already died...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I just wish you had someone[N]
ready to give their all[AN]
as you would do for your people[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Gadriel...thanks for your friendship,[N]
but you don’t need to...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[A][X]

## CalliopeSupportNausicaaTextC
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidRight][LoadCalliope][OpenMidRight]
Nausica[aa], I was thinking,[N]
as your advisor...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Wait a minute! since you[N]
were named my advisor?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Don’t tell me you don’t want[N]
me as your advisor!?![AN]
it would be a serious offense to me![AN]
since I am your friend[N]
from childhood![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Calliope, anyone with an idea or a[N]
plan to propose is welcome...[AN]
there is no need for an advisor[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh my, but it would be[N]
much nicer...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
The situation is not to be taken[AN]
lightly as if it was a joke[N]
[OpenMidRight]
You’re right, I was just trying[N]
to lighten the mood...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Come on! Try to be positive! Let’s[N]
think about when it’s all over[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I can’t think about the future...[N]
while we’re here fighting...[AN]
there’s too much at stake...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
It’s not easy I know, but we[N]
can’t bark in spirit,[AN]
you said it yourself to me long ago[AN]
Well...that’s my advice...remember[N]
you can count on me.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
I don’t know what scares me the most...[N]
the present or the future...[A][X]

## LukasSupportManfredTextC
[OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred][OpenMidRight][LoadLukas][OpenMidRight]
C-Captain?, Captain!!![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lukas, boy, have you decided[N]
to join this army?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes captain, I’m here to redeem the[N]
name of the empire,[AN] 
the name of the knights'order[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You’re just a boy...[AN]
a young soldier, you don't have to[N]
take charge of these things[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
No captain! I want to be[N]
a great knight, like you![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
You have a noble heart[N]
as a true knight,[AN]
it is a pity that you[N]
are only a squire[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
I am also happy to be a simple soldier[AN]
if it means being at your[N]
side, my Captain[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
Boy, take this spear...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Captain? Why are you giving[N]
me this spear?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
is a ceremonial spear[AN]
is given to the young[N]
knights of the empire[AN]
who are preparing to leave[N]
for a great enterprise[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I...I cannot accept this gift...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
and why? doing so[N]
offends me boy[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I’m not a knight[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You are in your heart, and it’s[N]
the most important thing[AN]
that’s why you deserve it.[AN]
It is not the title or his armor[N]
that makes a knight,[AN]
but his deeds, remember this Lukas[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
Captain...thank you...[A][X]

## DianaSupportRosieTextC
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDiana][OpenMidRight][LoadRosie][OpenMidLeft]
Rosie, I wanted to talk to[N]
you about something...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Diana?[AN]
What are you afraid? You know,[N]
you can talk to me freely![AN]
Is someone bothering you?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh, I suspected it![AN]
Well, tell me who it is so[N]
I’ll teach him a lesson![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
That’s what I wanted to[N]
talk to you about...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Uhm...?[AN]
Diana, what do you mean?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ever since we confronted[N]
the bandits...[AN]
I’ve noticed a change[N]
in your behavior...[AN]
You seem a lot more aggressive...[AN]
and the thing that scares me the most[N]
is that in battle...you feel no pity[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Mercy? Why would I show[N]
mercy to some monsters?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Those are not monsters![AN]
[CloseEyes]
I don’t know why you keep saying this![AN]
[OpenEyes]
I...I can’t go on anymore...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Diana, you’re just scared,[N]
and I get it,[AN]
anyone in this situation[N]
would be scared...[AN]
The problem is you keep thinking[N]
that we fight people,[AN]
while those are just beasts with[N]
the aim of killing you,[AN]
if you do not free the mind, you[N]
will facilitate their work...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You’re right, I’m just scared...[AN]
But the thing that scares me the most[N]
is not the battle...but you Rosie...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
One day you’ll understand...[A][X]

Are we ready to go?[AN]
[OpenRight]
One moment...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Kairs? there is something wrong?[AN]
[OpenRight][CloseEyes]
The name of our army...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
someone will have to remind[N]
us with a name[AN]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ah! ah! ah! ah![AN]
Time passes, but you haven't[N]
changed at all![AN]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
[OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
A name...uh...[OpenEyes]Nausica[aa][N]
you are in charge[AN]
only you can name the army that[N]
liberates these lands[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
This army represents the spirit[N]
of the people of Sorya...[AN]
Who has lived in this valley[N]
since the ancient day[AN]
the valley of the holy[N]
wind of life...[AN]
We are the wind's warriors![AN]

proud of this choice[A][X]

of the wind's warriors[AN]
march to Sorya[AN]
with the intent of freeing[N]
the lands of her people[AN]
She does not fear the[N]
incoming battle...[AN]
Decided to change a future[N]
apparently already written[AN]
willing to become a hero, one[N]
of the five legends...[AN]
But soon she will discover[AN]
that for all the[N]
victories...[AN]
to make history...[AN]
you have to pay a tribute...[A][X]
