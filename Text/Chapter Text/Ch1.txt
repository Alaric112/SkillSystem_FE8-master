Captain, I've been[N]
scouting the area[AN]
I must warn you, these are not[N]
simple bandits[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Colt, what do you mean[N]
for not mere bandits[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
First of all theirs[N]
equipment is brand new[AN]
never seen an axe of a[N]
bandit glisten[AN]
Plus the strange thing, that these[N]
have the arrogance of wanting[AN]
have a face-off[N]
face with us[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
[OpenMidRight]
They positioned themselves[N]
on the ridge[AN]
expect us to do[N]
the first move[AN]
[OpenLeft]
For wanting to fight[N]
openly, it means[AN]
which are much more[N]
numerous of us[AN]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x06][0x01][OpenRight]
They always remain bandits![AN]
we can't lose against[N]
these people[AN]
my sword is ready[N]
to everything[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xCB][0x01][OpenMidRight]
Captain, the boy has[N]
right![AN]
we are Sorya's guard[AN]
we cannot lose against[N]
this scum![AN]
[OpenLeft]
Don't underestimate the enemy[AN]
we have to think about[N]
princess protection[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Captain, you are wrong[AN]
you are not here to protect me[AN]
we are here to protect[N]
our citizens[AN]
the more time we spend lingering[N]
the more the dangerous will increase[AN]
if we all work together[N]
will we win the battle[AN]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x04][0x01][OpenRight]
Well said Nausica[aa][AN]
remaining united we can[N]
win the battle[AN]
our goal is to[N]
protect civilians[AN]
the more time we waste now, the[N]
more the enemy will gain[AN]
and they could take in[N]
civilians hostage[AN]
we can't allow it[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
So let's get ready to[N]
charge the enemy[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Captain, we can search also[N]
an alternative route[AN]
[OpenLeft]
It may be an idea[AN]
but we must first[N]
all think[AN]
to defend the nearby villages[AN]
Princess be careful, stay[N]
always close to me or to Paladin Kairs[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Don't worry Gilliam[AN]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xD6][0x01][OpenMidRight]
These people seem wanting[N]
to be serious...[AN]
they should have run away...[AN]
and instead they come to fight...[AN]
I don't like this job[AN]
but to defeat the Imperials...[N]
it needs sacrifices[A][X]

## Text6Ch1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x02][0x01][OpenMidLeft]

bandits to sow[AN]
further terror in[N]
our valley![A][X]
