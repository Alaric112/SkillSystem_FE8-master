Good morning My lady[AN]

with a strong state of anxiety[AN]
I would not like to disappoint[N]
you captain[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
princess, You have nothing[N]
to worry about[AN]
the bandits when they see Sorya's[N]
guard start to run away[AN]
it will not take long[N]
to capture them[AN]
Miss Yala, you can[N]
return to the castle[AN]

under our protection[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
Forgive me Captain, but I have[N]
decided to come too[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
The battlefields aren't made[N]
for priestesses[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Instead you are wrong[AN]
what if someone gets hurt?[AN]
my healing arts may be[N]
useful to you[AN]
please, I can’t spend all day[N]
at the castle[AN]
thinking the princess[N]
might get hurt[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]

[OpenFarRight][LoadGervaso][OpenRight][LoadFace][0xD6][0x01][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x4D][0x01][OpenMidLeft]
Boss! Boss![AN]
[OpenFarRight]
What is happening?[AN]
why all this noise?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Those damned yokels of[N]
campaign[AN]
they must have taken up arms![AN]
from their city is[N]
arriving a group[AN]
with the aim of capturing us![AN]
[OpenFarRight]
What idiots...we have ben[N]
other things to think about[AN]
the Imperial Jaggernaut will pass[N]
tomorrow night[AN]
and we must be ready to make[N]
the crimes of the empire pay...[AN]
with their blood![AN]
we don't have time[N]
to lose with this peasants![AN]
Dario![AN]
[OpenRight]
Yes Boss[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
You said you know[N]
well these lands[AN]
can you keep busy[N]
the peasants?[AN]
long enough for us to place[N]
the last of the beacons?[AN]
[OpenRight]
Me and my boys don't will have[N]
no problem with these people[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Perfect[AN]
try to distract their attention[N]
burning some farm around here[AN]
the important thing is they don’t[N]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x02][0x01][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x05][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadColt][OpenMidRight]
Captain, I've been[N]
scouting the area[AN]
I must warn you, these are not[N]
normal bandits[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Colt, what do you mean?[N]
they’re not just bandits?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
they are too well equipped[AN]
I never seen an axe of a[N]
bandit glisten[AN]
Also the strange thing, that these[N]
have the arrogance of wanting[AN]
to face us in an open fight[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
[OpenMidRight]
They’re positioned on the[N]
other side of the ridge[AN]
Waiting for us to make[N]
the first move[AN]
[OpenLeft]
For wanting to fight openly...[AN]
means that they are also[N]
in numerical superiority[AN]
[OpenRight][LoadGadriel][OpenRight]
They always remain bandits![AN]
we can't lose against[N]
these people[AN]
my sword is ready[N]
to everything[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadRosie][OpenMidRight]
Captain, the boy has a point![AN]
we are the Sorya's guard[AN]
we cannot lose against[N]
this scum![AN]
[OpenLeft]
Don't underestimate the enemy![AN]
we have to think about[N]
princess protection[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Captain, you are wrong[AN]
you are not here to protect me[AN]
we are here to protect[N]
our citizens[AN]
the more time we spend lingering[N]
the more the danger will increase[AN]
if we all work together[N]
will we win the battle[AN]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadKairs][OpenRight]
Well said Nausica[aa][AN]
remaining united we can[N]
win the battle[AN]
our goal is to[N]
protect civilians[AN]
the more time we waste now, the[N]
more the enemy will gain[AN]
and they could take[N]
civilians in hostage[AN]
we can't allow it[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
Then...ready to[N]
charge the enemy![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Captain, we can search also[N]
an alternative route[AN]
[OpenLeft]
It may be an idea[AN]
but we must first[N]
to defend the nearby villages[AN]
Princess be careful, stay[N]
always close to me or to paladin Kairs[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Don't worry Mito[AN]
come on let's go![A][X]

## Text5Ch1
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xD6][0x01][OpenMidRight]
These people seem wanting[N]
to be serious...[AN]
they should have run away...[AN]
and instead they come to fight...[AN]
I don't like this job[AN]
but to defeat the Imperials...[N]
it needs sacrifices[A][X]

## Text6Ch1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidLeft]
Come on![AN]
we can't allow these bandits to sow[AN]
further terror in our valley![A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x04][0x01][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x06][0x01][OpenMidRight]
Gadriel, please don't charge[N]
the enemy head down[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Grandpa, I see you are a little[N]
agitated, is all right?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm worried...[N]
for you[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Uh...Why?[AN]
you teach a lot of things about[N]
how to wield a sword[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Gadriel, you have to understand that[N]
in battle, anything can happen[AN]
the techniques I taught you[N]
are just the basics[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
But these are just[N]
bandits![AN]
they don't even know those![N]
come on grandpa, don't worry![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
No Gadriel...my instincts tells[N]
me these aren't bandits[AN]
please, always stay at[N]
my side[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Of course I stay close to you![AN]
otherwise with your old bad back[N]
you risk being killed![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
What a boy...if only[N]
your mother can see you now...[AN]
[CloseEyes]
Julia...I will protect your[N]
son at any cost[A][X]

## TextTalk2Ch1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x06][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x02][0x01][OpenMidLeft]
Nausica[aa] watch your back![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Gadriel? but I have none[N]
behind me[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
For now, but I'm going now[N]
charge the enemy[AN]
and I will not be able to stay[N]
at your side[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
sorry, but why do you have to[N]
charge the enemy?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
In order to use the new[N]
technique I learned[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
It is not a valid motivation...[N]
you just risk getting killed...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
But these are just[N]
simple bandits![AN]
with my technique I could vanquish[N]
them all with one hit![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
What if you're wrong?[AN]
the enemy would have time[N]
to hit you[AN]
and being far from we are, you'd[N]
be completely surrounded[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]... ... ...[AN]
ok, ok, you've a point[AN]
we charge together, like this,[N]
they will have no chance of winning![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
I don't understand what's[N]
going through his head[AN]
what does he expect to achieve?[A][X]

## TextTalk3Ch1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDiana][OpenMidRight][LoadRosie][OpenMidRight]
Diana, are you all right?[AN]
why are you shaking like[N]
a dry leaf?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
R-Rosie...I-I'm a bit scared[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Fear? and for what?[AN]
stay calm, while you can stay[N]
behind me, you will be safe[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's not why[N]
I'm upset...[AN]
I am a huntress...[AN]
I've never used mine[N]
bow against people...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
But we are not fighting people![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
What!?[AN]
but those are...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Those are just beasts, filthy demons[AN]
that looks like a person to[N]
deceive people like you[AN]
make them think they are[N]
really human...ugh, disgusting[AN]
they only deserve death[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
I don't understand...those...[N]
they are really people....[A][X]

I wanted to congratulate you![AN]

old man in town [AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
I don't know what you're talking about[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Don't deceive me[AN]
I met the old man[N]
and he said you helped him[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Are you done?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Done?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
To waste time[AN]

Dario, the enemies are[N]
getting too close[AN]
I have prepared some boys[N]
to burn some villages[AN]
this will keep them busy[N]
enough time[AN]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
it is right to sacrifice this[N]
people to make the empire pay?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Dario?[AN]
you forgot what they have they made[N]
us the dogs of the empire?[AN]
these ignorant yokels are[N]
also their accomplices[AN]
they think they are blessed[N]
in their valley[AN]
while the empire spreads[N]
death and destruction[AN]
we have to stop them![AN]
The dogs of the empire must[N]
be stopped![AN]
