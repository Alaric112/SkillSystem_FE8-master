Following this road we will arrive[N]
at the entrance of desert[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Master Salem, can you tell me something[N]
more about the desert[AN]
in particular, I always have asked[N]
how the people out of the valley[AN]
they manage to live[AN]
I know the deserts out in the valley,[N]
are much more common[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
it is true, outside the[N]
valley of the wind...[AN]
all other nations are divided[N]
by vast deserts[AN]
even if in the center there are[N]
some kind of oasis...[AN]
even if they are real forests[N]
considering the size[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Oh yes, the toxic jungles[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Exactly[AN]
they are usually the hideouts[N]
of demons[AN]
[OpenMidRight]In fact in the center of[N]
our world there is the big tree[AN]
surrounded by an immense forest,[N]
larger than our valley[AN]
all men call it the[N]
nest of evil[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
just the thought of it[N]
makes me tremble[AN]
and from there that all are born[N]
the demons that haunt our world[AN]
[OpenLeft]
So how do people live[N]
outside the valley?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Through the airships...[AN]
fantastic machines running[N] 
through an ether furnace[AN]
they can fly in the celestial sea[AN]
[OpenLeft]
I thought the airships[N]
were just a legend[AN]
I've never seen one...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Master Salem instead[N]
he drove a real one![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
]Yes, before my arrive[N]
in the valley[AN]
I was following my studies at[N]
an academy of wizards[AN]
located in the islands to the north[N]
of the big tree[AN]
close to the Republic of Alistar[AN]
as the ocean waters are poisonous[AN] 
the only way to cross them[N]
was to use airships[AN]
[OpenLeft]
I have heard of it[N]
of this kingdom[AN]
it is often mentioned[N]
with the empire...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
of Granorg![AN]
they are known by all for[N]
heir countless wars...[AN]
who knows if they continue now[N]
to do battle...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
eleven years ago a armistice[N]
between these two nations[AN]
but the truth that the scenery[N]
of wars has moved[AN]
now we talk about one[N]
economic warfare[AN]
where, at least until[N]
to my latest news[AN]
the empire was suffering a[N]
strong crisis[AN]
[OpenLeft]
]How can a nation so big[N]
to go into crisis?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
The main reasons are[N]
two[AN]
the empire is more afflicted[N]
by the desertification[AN]
and from the raids of demons[AN]
also the great cardinal[N]
of the Goddess[AN]
moved into the neutral territory[N]
of the islands of Talmia[AN]
this was a serious blow for the[N]
entire imperial economic system[AN]
[OpenLeft]
So how do they do it?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
In the empire they manage to exploit[N]
more aether flows[AN]
the Imperial processing of metal[N]
is still unbeaten[AN]
but fails to satisfy the[N]
whole nation completely...[AN]
the paradox that the empire always[N]
tries to expand its territories[AN]
goes in search of new colonies[AN]
[OpenLeft].... ... ...[AN]
One day they might[N]
get here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I doubt it[AN]
our world is separate[N]
from the nest of evil[AN]
they should first create[N]
an opening...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
And the airships?[AN]
they could not fly[N]
above?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
In theory yes but there[N]
aren't furnaces so powerful[AN]
and also it must consider[N]
flying demons[AN]
Oh to speak, we are arrived[N]
at destination[AN]
[OpenLeft]
then let's get ready[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Nausica[aa], attention, I have[N]
saw flying demons[A][X]

## Text2Ch2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x20][0x01][OpenMidLeft]
If my research are[N]
correct[AN]
the stream of ether is[N]
found in those ruins[AN]
I have to reach them for to be able[N]
to make the necessary analyzes[A][X]

## Text3Ch2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10][0x01][OpenMidLeft]
Beware Nausica[aa], a sandstorm[N]
approaches![A][X]

## Text4Ch2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x20][0x01][OpenMidLeft]
Watch out! a sandstorm[N]
approaches![A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xCB][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadColt][OpenMidLeft]
Hey Colt![AN]
[OpenMidRight]... ... ...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I wasn't expecting that you would[N]
have accompanied the girl[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You are here alone[N]
to tell me this?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh no, no I saw you move[N]
very nimbly in the sand[AN]
and then I know you have a[N]
excellent view...[AN]
you know in the desert sands[N]
you can find old treasures[AN]
it would be interesting...[N]
can you find them?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]... ... ...[AN]
I don't see where do you[N]
want to arrive[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Come on you have me understood[N]
very well![AN]
I'm sure in these sands we[N]
can find some treasures![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
and what should i do[N]
with it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Okay, don't worry, but if you stumble[N]
on some precious stone[AN]
at least try to get it[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
but who did he[N]
take me for?[A][X]

## TextTalk2Ch2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x0A][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10][0x01][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
... ... ...[AN]
I have never seen a person falling[N]
asleep at the standing[AN][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Ahhhhh![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Hey, calm down, I don't want[N]
hurt you![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You are not a demon, are you?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
you see I have[N]
horns?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Not all demon[N]
have horns...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
... ... ...[AN]
true...in fact I can[N]
create flames...[AN]
so I could be[N]
a demon?[AN]
are you afraid of me?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
AHHHHHHH![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
... ... ...[AN]
I didn't think it was so[N]
emotional...[AN]
it was just a joke![A][X]

## TextTalk3Ch2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x06][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10][0x01][OpenMidLeft]
Er... hello I wanted...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Hi![AN]
you must be the grandson[N]
of the paladin Kairs![AN]
it is a pleasure to make friends[N]
with you![AN]
I hear, it is very strict[N]
your grandfather?[AN]
for example my teacher[N]
every time I detonate[AN]
something in the house, it touches me[N]
clean everything EVERY time![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Um...nice to meet[N]
you...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh what a careless! not me[N]
I am properly presented[AN]
my name is Calliope, I am long time[N]
friend of Nausica[aa][AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
About this...I wanted[N]
to ask you, being...[AN]
friend of Nausica[aa] from[N]
a long time...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh sure, I know her[N]
perfectly![AN]
but I do not like it talk about[N]
others when they are not there[AN]
if you want to ask her something[N]
I'll gladly accompany you[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]... ... ...[AN]
uh, don't worry, don't worry...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]... ... ...[AN]
but he is gone[N]
like this?[AN]
... ... ...[AN]
what a strange guy[A][X]

## TextTalk4Ch2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x20][0x01][OpenMidLeft]
... ... ...[AN]
The crystal to ether stands[N]
shining more than usual...[AN]
indicates that way...[AN]
what this object?[AN]
... ... ...[AN]
appears to be a small[N]
furnace...heart-shaped?[AN]
I have never seen the crystals[N]
be so bright[AN]
the stream of ether it emits this[N] 
source must be incredible[A][X]

## TextTalk5Ch2
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x20][0x01][OpenMidRight]
I recovered the[N]
material[AN]
we can leave now![A][X]

## TextEnd1Ch2
To complete the chapter you[N]
need escape with Salem [A][X]

## TextEnd2Ch2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x20][0x01][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x10][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x02][0x01][OpenMidRight]
I have to admit ... I didn't[N]
expected it would be[AN]
so tiring cross the desert[AN]
[OpenLeft]
the important thing that we are[N]
managed to get out all whole[AN]
together with the artifact[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Master Salem, out of curiosity[N]
can we see it?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Of course! pay attention it[N]
is small, but very heavy[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Oh misery! it's very heavy[N]
to be so small![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
but it's light as a feather[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]... ... ...[AN]
[OpenLeft]Tell me you're kidding![AN] 
it is not possible[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
No, I'm serious, it also[N]
has a strange shape[AN]
looks like a metal heart...[AN]
[OpenLeft]... ... ...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Interesting...very interesting...[AN]
this source of ether seemed[N]
to dissolve...[AN]
as Nausica[aa] took the artifact[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Salem, what is this artifact?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Some kind of source of ether[N]
mechanical and non-biological...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
the ether...is the essence of life![N]
if he reacted like this to me...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
It could be the catalyst that[N]
could cure your father[AN]
the artifact has stopped radiating the ether[N]
in the air, but it started...[AN]
to flow into you, this explains how[N]
you managed to lift the object[AN]
without any effort![AN]
[OpenLeft]
But how come it only works[N]
with Nausica[aa]?[AN]
What evidence do we have that it works[N]
for the king too?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
the object must be connected to[N]
Sorya's lineage in some way[AN]
reacts only with his[N]
descendants ... [AN]
[OpenLeft]
What luck then![AN]
Nausica[aa] we must return as[N]
fast as possible in the city![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You're right Calliope, with this object[N]
we can save my father[AN]
thank you from the bottom[N]
of my heart all of you[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Oh, you know we've been friends[N]
for a long time![AN]
I could never have left[N]
you alone![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
My job is to search for Sorya this[N]
fits perfectly into my duties[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Oh master, stop doing that[N]
without feeling![AN]
you can see in your eyes that[N]
you are exploding with joy![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]... ... ...[AN]
very acute observation...[N]
I must admit...[A]
that it is difficult to remain[N]
calm in this situation[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
So a good reason to start returning[N]
to the city[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Right! we are behind you![A][X]
