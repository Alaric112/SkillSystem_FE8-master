Welcome back my daughter![AN]
I finally summon you to this[N]
hall, not to scold you[AN]
*coff* *coff*[N]
but to congratulate[AN]
I got the report of the[N]
captain Gilliam[AN]
*coff* *coff*[N]
you were good Nausica[aa][AN]
*coff* now I can...rest assured[N]
that *coff* our...people...[AN]
is *coff* in good hands[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Father don't say that![AN]
you still have many[N]
things to live for![AN]
I'm not yet[N]
ready to...[A]
[OpenRight]
My dear...*coff*[AN]
you will always have to be ready[AN]
*coff* any time[AN]
*coff* you always have to think *coff*[AN]
for the good of our people[AN]
remember Nausica[aa] we have[N]
the task... *coff*[AN]
to protect our valley[AN]
don't think about me[AN]
*coff* *coff*[AN]
now go to rest...[N]
rest is important[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Yes father...[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Wait my lady![AN]
with your permission my king[AN]
young master Salem is back from his[N] 
research done in the desert of Mikta[AN]
He claims to have found one[N]
source of suspect ether[AN]
has requested to receive[N]
an escort to go and inspect it[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Father, I volunteer![AN]
[OpenRight]Nausica[aa] absolutely not![AN]
that desert is territory[N]
of demons[AN]
if there is a source of ether it will[N]
say that nearby[AN]
whole herds swarm[N]
of demons[AN]
it's too dangerous for you![AN]
you're not ready yet[AN]
[OpenLeft]
But father, I have dealt with it already[N]
the demons in the past[AN]
even before that group[N]
of bandits[AN]
[OpenRight]
But you won't have the support[N]
of captain Gilliam[AN]
*coff* *coff*[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
My lord, if you like I can[N]
entrust the command[AN]
of my team to Nausica[aa][AN]
at the moment they are free as long[N]
I don't end up with the prisoners[AN]
[OpenRight]*coff* *coff*[AN]
Gilliam, try to find out[AN]
what these bandits wanted[AN]
*coff* *coff*[N]
you said you captured[AN]
their leader, then take me from[N]
him, I have to ask him some questions[AN]
As for you Nausica[aa] ... you want[N]
really undertake this mission[AN]
* coff * * coff * with Master Salem?[AN]
[OpenLeft]Yes father![AN][OpenRight]... ... ...[AN]
* coff * * coff *[AN]
please my daughter[AN]
be careful, the desert[N]
is dangerous[AN]
if the situation becomes[N]
too dangerous[AN]
I want you to come back immediately[N]
back! did we understand each other?[AN]
[OpenLeft]Don't worry Father[N]
I will not be in any danger[AN]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight]
... ... ...[AN]

Nausica[aa]!!![AN]
you are finally back from your mission,[N] 
I'm happy to see you safe[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Calliope![AN]
yes, let's let's say we did it[AN]
but it was all about it[N]
by Captain Gilliam[AN]
where are you going?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Princess, we're trying[N]
to convince the king[AN]
to give us an escort for[N]
a research mission...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I see you haven't been,[N]
still warned[AN]
I will be your escort[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
What!?!?[AN]
but it is too dangerous[N]
for you![AN]
you're the princess, you can't[N]
expose yourself to these dangers![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Instead it's the other way around, but[N]
we will not be alone[AN]
I was going to ask[N]
help to others[AN]
[OpenLeft]
... ... ...[AN]
the desert represents[N]
a great challenge[AN]
but we will probably face[N]
also demons[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Salem, this research has that[N]
do with caring for my father?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Yes...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Then I have no doubts[AN]
I make preparations for the trip[N]
and then we leave immediately[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Wow, Nausica[aa], you are[N]
really energetic today[AN]
we are not in such a hurry[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
The opposite, my father's[N]
life hangs by a thread[AN]
I have to move, to do something[AN]
now, finally I have the chance[AN]
[OpenLeft]
I understand your feelings[AN]
I will prepare the material[N]
for the research[AN]
when everything is ready let's meet[N] 
on the west street[AN]
I know a shortcut to[N]
reach the desert[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Good![A][X]

## Text3Ch1x

preparations go talk to Salem[A][X]

## TextTalk1part1Ch1x

[OpenMidLeft]
Master Salem, for my[N]
father's salvation[AN]
I will run any danger[AN]
I have to thank you[N]
for everything you are doing[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
No, no, It's just[N]
my duty[AN]

the desert more easily[A][X]

## TextTalk1part4Ch1x
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x02][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x20][OpenMidRight]
Ah, before I forget[AN]
I tried to distill the herbs[N]
medicines you found[AN]
unfortunately they don't go[N]
well for the king's sickness[AN]
but I managed to get it[N]
at least some healing potions[AN]
keep them, they could[N]
be profits[A][X]

## TextTalk1part5Ch1x
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x20][0x01][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x02][0x01][OpenMidRight]

*coff* *coff*[AN]
Well done, captain[AN]
then "sir" can we[N]
know your name?[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]

Now the bandits don't[N]
have a name?[AN]

interesting...then who are you?[AN]
[OpenLeft]... ... ...[AN]
[OpenRight]
I understand, you define yourself[N]
like parasites[AN]
*coff* *coff*[AN]
parasites affecting the[N]
lands of my people[AN]
the houses of the inhabitants burned[N]
of the valley, just for fun[AN]
you are not very different[N]
from demons ...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
You're just a fool[AN]
an arrogant king of these[N]
campaigns[AN]
you and your people do you believe[N]
safe in your valley[AN]
but it's not like that[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
See to tone it down![AN]
Or my spear will do it![AN]
[OpenRight]
Gilliam, let him talk[AN]
maybe he will tell us why it[N]
is in our valley[AN]
*coff* *coff*[AN]
[OpenLeft]... ... ...[AN]
Now I understand,[AN] 
you think your death will be caused[N]
by the disease that afflicts you[AN]
but it's not like that![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
How dare you! ugly worm[N]
good for nothing![AN]
[OpenRight]*coff* *coff* Gilliam...[N]
let him speak[AN]
[OpenLeft]
The flames of the war[N]
will soon come[AN]
you will be overwhelmed[N]
like everyone else[AN]
The empire will take the[N]
your heads[AN]
and the survivors will be[N]
their slaves[AN]
you have no hope![AN]
[OpenRight]
The empire?[AN]
are you talking about the[N]
empire of Granorg?[AN]
it is hundreds of thousands[N]
of miles from here[AN]
moors, rivers, deserts separate us[AN]
*coff* *coff*[AN]
also the great tree of evil[N]
with its toxic jungle![AN]
separate our worlds![AN]
it's impossible![AN]
don't come and tell me[N]
these stupid lies![AN]
[OpenLeft]
... ... ...[A][OpenRight]
Do you want to tell us the truth?[AN]
what did you come to[N]
really do?[AN]
some of your companions are[N]
still on the loose[AN]
we are committed[N]
to capture you[AN]
*coff* *coff*[AN]
but with the others I will give order[N]
to kill them, if you don't speak[AN]
*coff* *coff*[A][OpenLeft]
My companions and I...are ready[N]
to die...our cause...[AN]
is worth all the lives he asks for...[AN]
[OpenRight]
Gilliam lock up in the cells[N]
this man[AN]
perhaps the cold of the[N]
prison breaks his tongue[AN]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight]
One last thing...[AN]
Gilliam, I want you to send some[N]
explorers on our borders[AN]
and send a message to[N]
Ryu's people[AN][OpenFarLeft]
My king, you won't really believe[N]
to those stories...[AN]

something...something me[N]
says to be on enguard[AN]
his words...conceal[N]
a truth...[AN]
maybe even worse....[AN]
*coff* *coff*[AN]
