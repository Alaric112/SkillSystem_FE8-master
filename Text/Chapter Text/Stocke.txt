My lord we have reached the[N]
territories of the white hills[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
before starting our investigations[AN]
it would be better to go through[N]
the local imperial fort[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
To reach it faster, we should go[N]
through the city of flionde[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
It will also be an excellent[N]
opportunity to meet the locals...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
My lord, it would be better avoid[N]
exposing yourself in this way[AN]
the situation in this area[N]
is extremely delicate...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
We can't ignore this![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ....[AN]
[OpenEyes]
I'm just telling you not to[N]
introduce yourself "formally"[AN]
it could cause serious problems,[N]
we must be cautious![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Let us concentrate on meeting[N]
the local guard[AN]
and the lord of this region...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Mmm...you are right[A][X]

My lord is too dangerous![N]
we don't have the strength![AN]
there are many more than us![AN]
the best thing to do is to[N]
find another way....[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
it is our duty to defend the[N]
Imperial citizens of this city[AN]
I will not leave them to their fate![A][X]
