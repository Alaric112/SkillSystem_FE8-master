We’re almost at the[N]
gates of Sorya...[AN]
[OpenRight]
It seems our enemies have[N]
decided to finally face us[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
They’re more than I imagined...[AN]
How sad to see so many men of the[N]
Empire that follow the follies[AN]
of a single man...[AN]
It is an unbearable shame...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenRight]
Nausica[aa], if we can[N]
cross the river[AN]
that passes between these hills, we[N]
can directly hit the enemy commander[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
If we succeeded, many soldiers would[N]
surrender without a fight...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
It sounds like a good idea...[N]
the sooner the better![AN]
Come on wind's warriors, the people[N]
of Sorya count on us! to victory![AN]

## StartText2Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZek][OpenMidLeft]
To arms, valiant soldiers[N]
of the empire![AN]
we will not surrender to[N]
the forces of Alistar![AN]
we will die if necessary![AN]
glory to the Empire of Granorg![A][X]

## StartText3Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZek][OpenMidRight][LoadNikolai][OpenMidLeft]
Nikolai, it does you honor[N]
to stay and fight[AN]
while the others in your brigade[N]
flee from the battle[AN]
Kushana is just a vile traitor![AN]
she only think about saving her[N]
face in front of the Emperor![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I...I can’t figure out why[N]
captain Manfred escaped...[AN]
he was a true loyal knight[N]
of the empire[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
I know the captain from[N]
long time...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
and yet I cannot understand[N]
why he abandoned us...[AN]
You’re right, he was a great[N]
knight of the Empire[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Lieutenant Zek, leave the[N]
front row to me[AN]
I want to fight like[N]
Manfred was![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
It does you credit, boy...[AN]
if only all the knights of the empire[N]
had a noble heart like your...[AN]
By now, victory would be ours...[A][X]

## MidText1Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZek][OpenMidLeft]
damn I didn't expect them[N]
to reach us that fast[AN]
[CloseEyes]
I underestimated them...[N]
at this rate...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadShamanPurple][OpenMidRight]
You seem in trouble, lieutenant...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
*!!!*[AN]
What are wormhandlers doing here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
We’re here on Slayder'behalf[N]
and we give you our help[AN]
and our new weapon...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
What the...hell is that thing![AN]
I will never accept help[N]
from people like you![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Too bad...because you[N]
seemed in trouble...[AN]
I thought your loyalty to the[N]
empire was stronger...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Wait![AN]
[CloseEyes]
I...I accept your help...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Excellent...you keep busy a[N]
little more our enemies[AN]
The stone will do the rest[A][X]

## MidText2Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidLeft]
Urgh...[AN]
Aaaaahhh!!![AN]
[OpenRight][LoadCalliope][OpenFarRight][LoadKairs][OpenRight]
Nausica[aa]! what happened?[N]
are you hurt?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Nausica[aa]! Come to your senses![AN]
say what happened[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I...I don’t know...suddenly I feel[N]
my head exploding...[AN]
I hear screams...screams of[N]
uncontrolled anger...[AN]
[OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
What do these screams say?[AN]
[OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don’t understand their words...[N]
but I feel their anger...[AN]
[OpenRight]
What the hell is going[N]
on with the sky?[AN]
Look![AN]
A light went out of that hill![A][X]

## MidText3Ch8
[OpenFarLeft][LoadCatherina][OpenLeft][LoadManfred][OpenRight][LoadKairs][OpenFarRight][LoadCalliope]
[OpenLeft]
Kairs! What happened to Nausica[aa]?[AN]
[OpenRight]
I don’t know exactly...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
I feel a strange presence...[AN]
Whatever happened to her is also[N]
connected in some way[AN]
with this sudden change in the sky[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
it started when a strange ray of[N]
light started from that hill[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Watch! suddenly a huge black monolith[N]
appeared on top of the hill![AN]
[OpenFarRight][LoadNausicaa][OpenFarRight]
Kairs ... I think I understand[N]
some words of those screams[AN]
[OpenLeft]
What do they say?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
They’re angry at that[N]
black stone...[AN]
they want to destroy it![AN]
The screams...the voices...[N]
are the demons![AN]
they are trying to communicate[N]
with me[AN]
To destroy that stone, they will[N]
burn everything to the ground![AN]
We must prevent this from happening![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Are you sure about that?[AN]
Demons are evil creatures...but...[AN]
this is not their territory[N]
and it is impossible talk with them...[AN]
[OpenRight]
We must believe Nausicaa! I’m sure[N]
she’s telling the truth![AN]
[OpenLeft]
That means we have to destroy[N]
that stone first![AN]
We have no time to waste! let's move![A][X]

## MidText4Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCatherina][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
Nausicaa, you are[N]
a kind soul...[AN]
Yet in you I feel a strange[N]
presence...[AN]
I have no other choice for now...[AN]
I have to trust her, for[N]
Alistar's sake...[A][X]

## MidText5Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNikolai][OpenMidLeft]
what is happening? the[N]
sky suddenly changed[AN]
[CloseEyes]
Should I go back?[AN]
[OpenEyes]
No, I can't back away right now[AN]
But there is something[N]
strange in the air...[A][X]

## MidText6Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMercenaryGreen][OpenMidRight][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidLeft]
princess, a large number of[N]
demons are approaching![AN]
We cannot fight two fronts, must[N]
we withdraw?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
The demons are not[N]
our real enemies,[AN]
if we destroy the black[N]
stone, they will retreat[AN]
try to avoid engaging[N]
battle with them[A][X]

## MidText7Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZek][OpenMidLeft]
Our lives are already marked...[AN]
let's make our last[N]
fight glorious![AN]
with me brave knights we[N]
strike the enemy![A][X]

## ManfredTalkNikolaiCh8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred][OpenMidRight][LoadNikolai][OpenMidRight]
Captain Manfred?!?[AN]
I thought you abandoned us...[AN]
that you were fled with princess[N]
Kushana...but instead...[AN]
have you joined the enemy?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Nikolai, what are you doing[N]
with Slayder's forces?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
To fight the enemies[N]
of the empire![AN]
Alistar's forces have attacked us![AN]
They are ready to use anything[N]
to defeat us![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
This army is not from Alistar![AN]
I joined them to fight in[N]
the name of the Empire![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I don't understand...you are[N]
fighting for the empire...[AN]
these are not from Alistar?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Nikolai, you are a good knight[N]
rejoin me![AN]
I'm here to redeem the name of[N]
the knights of the empire[AN]
the traitor is General Slayder![AN]
He's using a mysterious stone[N]
to lure demons here![AN]
he is responsible for all of this![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
[CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
Captain, forgive me[N]
for doubting you[AN]
I will return to your[N]
ranks with pleasure![A][X]

## LukasTalkNikolaiCh8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLukas][OpenMidRight][LoadNikolai][OpenMidRight]
What is a soldier of the empire[N]
doing with Alistar's army!?[AN]
I thought that the others were cowards[N]
and that they had run away...[AN]
but to know that there[N]
are also traitors...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
No, you're wrong![AN]
I'm not a traitor[AN]
I'm with this army to redeem[N]
the name of the Empire[AN]
this army fights only to[N]
free its lands[AN]
it is not in the pay of Alistar,[N]
rather it has driven them out![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Why should I believe your words?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Because if you are a true knight of[N]
the empire you should believe me![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I wonder who was ever[N]
really a knight...[AN]
[CloseEyes]
Captain Manfred why[N]
did you run away?[AN]
What am I really fighting for?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Please Wait! don't go away![AN]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
What do you want now? I have no[N]
reason to fight you...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You know Captain Manfred?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I’m his subordinate...[AN]
and I owe him my life[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Then you have a reason[N]
to fight with me![AN]
The captain is helping this army[N]
in the name of the empire![AN]
The only real traitor is Slayder![AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
If thou speak'st false, you[N]
are a dead man[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Well, we can ask the[N]
captain directly![A][X]

## EndText1Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred]
Many of these soldiers...[AN]
Their hearts were still moved by[N]
loyalty to the empire...[AN]
Why? Why, why![AN]
Her highness Kushana...[AN]
Is it possible that this[N]
was the only way?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadNausicaa]
Sir Manfred don’t feel[N]
obligated to stay[AN]
you have already done much[AN]
but this is my battle, the battle[N]
of my people, no longer yours[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
No...now this is[N]
also my battle[AN]
[OpenEyes]
I must continue, I must do it for[N]
those who died in this madness[AN]
At any cost I must know the[N]
meaning of their sacrifice[AN]
Slayder will have to answer![AN]
For this young queen, I will[N]
stay by your side![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
It’s an honor to have[N]
you by my side[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadMercenaryGreen]
Princess!!![AN]
I bring urgent news![AN]
Knights of Rhun have arrived![AN]
and their King, Theodoros is in charge![AN]
He asks for you, my lady![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I can’t believe it![AN]
our neighbors came to our aid,[N]
take me to them, soon![A][X]

## EndText2Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidRight][LoadTheodoros][OpenMidLeft]
King Theodoros![AN]
It’s an honor to meet you![AN]
have you come to help[N]
us in our struggle?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
You must be Jhil’s daughter, right?[AN]
I asked to talk to him...[AN]
tell me, where he is?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
My father fell in battle[N]
to defend us...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
I thought he was leading[N]
this army...[AN]
[OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft]
What a tragedy has fallen[N]
to these lands...[AN]
Look at the state of the[N]
people of Sorya...[AN]
to think it was the greatest and[N]
proudest of all the valley...[AN]
now it’s just a bargaining chip for[N]
the barbarians of the outside[AN]
I have no reason to help you[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]
Theodoros, you should bring[N]
more respect to this girl[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadKairs]
[OpenFarLeft]
In other times, you wouldn’t[N]
disrespect Sorya’s sovereign[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Kairs...please...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
She? ruler of Sorya?[AN]
don’t make me laugh stormcrow[AN]
What I’m looking at is just[N]
a cowardly little girl[AN]
who to save her life...[AN]
has sold the honor of Sorya's[N]
people to other invaders![AN]

## EndText2Ch8
[OpenFarLeft][LoadKairs][OpenLeft][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidRight][LoadTheodoros]
[OpenFarLeft]
"King" Theodoros, your words[N]
offend Jhil’s memory![AN]
you’ve changed, the king I knew would[N]
never abandon his friends...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Funny, coming from a person[N]
like you, Stormcrow[AN]
Since your first arrival[AN]
Jhil has helped you many times, but in[N]
the end you have always abandoned him![AN]
you have brought only misfortune to[N]
the valley of the wind...[AN]
I wouldn’t be surprised to find out[N]
it was you who brought these[AN]
barbarians into my valley![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]
I carry with me many sins[N]
and regrets...[AN]
including never having[N]
truly repaid Jhil...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
But to ease my pain, I’ll help this[N]
girl as long as I have life[AN]
This land is not yours, but of...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You really think I’m gonna let[N]
this girl go free?[AN]
I...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Enough![AN]
I’ve had enough of this[N]
ridiculous talk![AN]
The valley of the wind[N]
belongs to no one![AN]
This land has always been the refuge[N]
of all peoples who need it[AN]
the sole objective of a sovereign is[N]
to defend the freedom of his people[AN]
and that’s what my father did to the[N]
end, and that’s what I’m gonna do[AN]
King Theodoros if you intend to threaten[N]
the freedom of the Sorya people...[AN]
or any other inhabitant of the[N]
Valley of the Wind[AN]
Then you must fight me![AN]
[CloseEyes]
I promised my father I’d[N]
live up to it[AN]
I promised my sister I’d[N]
come back to her[AN]
I promised my people I would[N]
free our homes[AN]
I...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
... ... ...
[OpenEyes]
finally words that show[N]
true courage[AN]
Can you promise me something?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
It depends on what?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Prove to all that my words were false[N]
by defeating this rabble of barbarians[AN]
Show me you’re strong and[N]
worthy of your father[AN]
If you do not, many others will lay[N]
their eyes on the valley...[AN]
and there will be no one to help[AN]
That said, I withdraw, may the[N]
wind blow in your favor[A][X]

[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Nausicaa...I wanted to...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Kairs, thanks for coming back[AN]
but King Theodoros is right[N]
about one thing...[AN]
we have to get Sorya back now![A][X]

## EndText4Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidRight][LoadCalliope]
[OpenMidRight]
Look Nausica[aa]![AN]
we are at the gates of our city[AN]
I’ve never seen them with[N]
this perspective...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Even in ruins, they emanate[N]
an aura of beauty...[AN]
let’s finish this story[N]
once and for all[A][X]

## EndText5Ch8
That day, no help came from[N]
the Rum Knights...[AN]
This grew a strong resentment[N]
among the warriors of the wind,[AN]
it was as if a brother[N]
had betrayed them[AN]
And yet, the young maiden, she smiled[N]
looking at a city of Sorya[AN]
She said:[AN]
"It's Time to return to our homes"[AN]
A loud roar echoes[N]
throughout the valley[AN]
The flames of the hearts of the[N]
people of Sorya revived again[AN]
she represented the last light[N]
for the valley[AN]
Against such tenacity and fury many[N]
invaders decided to surrender[AN]
others fled in fear...[AN]
Only a few, had the[N]
madness to fight[AN]
When the sun went down, the warriors[N]
of the wind entered their city[AN]
The dawn of the new day[AN]
the young princess took with[N]
her most valiant companions[AN]
and charged the last enemies who[N]
fortified themselves[AN]
within the castle of his people[AN]
She wanted to end this story[N]
as quickly as possible[AN]
But the madness of men should[N]
not be underestimated,[AN]
even if they were trapped rats[AN]
their leader still had a[N]
card to play...[AN]
even at the cost of losing[N]
his humanity,[AN]
he would have tried to get[N]
out of that hole[A][X]
