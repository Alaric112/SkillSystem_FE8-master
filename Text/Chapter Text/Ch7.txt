Here we are men![AN]
Here lies the last obstacle to the[N]
affirmation of the empire[AN]
in these stupid lands![AN]
they barricaded themselves in the[N]
mountains and these cliffs...[AN]
but they can't do anything[N]
against our iron fist![AN]
prepare the cavalry! we will overwhelm[N]
them with a single charge![A][X]

## Text2Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKairs][OpenRight][LoadCivilian1][OpenFarRight][LoadMercenaryGreen][OpenFarRight]
Paladin! The Imperials are preparing[N]
for the second attack![AN]
[OpenRight]
Oh no! we no longer have[N]
the strength to fight![AN]
Is it possible that there is[N]
only the surrender left?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Surrender is no longer[N]
an alternative![AN]
If we do, they'll kill us[N]
all the same![AN]
[OpenRight]
but why?[AN]
not only did their ship crash and[N]
we also tried to help them[AN]
with the survivors...[AN]
and now they come to kill us[N]
as if we were demons...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I do not know...maybe they hold us[N]
responsible for the accident?[AN]
[CloseEyes]
Yet...Nausica[aa] was on board...[N]
damn I failed...[AN]
Jhil...forgive me...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
Listen to me men of the valley![AN]
we have nowhere to hide, by now these[N]
bastards have stolen everything from us[AN]
except for our courage and our[N]
love for this valley.[AN]
who can still wield a weapon, follow[N]
me to Sorya's last defense![A][X]

## Text3Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKairs][OpenMidRight][LoadGadriel][OpenMidRight]
Grandpa! it's time to make these[N]
damn people pay[AN]
let me stand in the front row,[N]
I have to avenge Nausica[aa]...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Gadriel ... I understand how you feel[AN]
but you must not be blinded[N]
by rage, in battle[AN]
or you would risk dying even[N]
before you draw your blade[A][X]

## Text4Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKairs][OpenMidRight][LoadRosie][OpenMidRight]
it was lucky to be able to escape[N]
from the crash[AN]
just to cut off some heads[N]
of these pigs![A][X]

## Text5Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKairs][OpenMidRight][LoadDiana][OpenMidRight]
I-I'm not afraid...[N]
I'm not afraid...[AN]
no, instead I'm very[N]
afraid...but...[AN]
I will be with you to repel[N]
these conquerors[A][X]

## Text6Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKairs][OpenMidRight][LoadDiana][OpenMidRight]
Sir![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Boy, what are you still doing here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You have saved me twice[N]
from the flames...[AN]
I swear that these do not come[N]
by order of Princess Kushana[AN]
is the brigade of General Slayder...[AN]
I don't know why they do this...[AN]
but I won't let them tarnish the honor[N]
of the real knights of the empire![AN]
I'll fight with you![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You will be considered a deserter...[N]
they won't spare you out there[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I don't care, a real knight[N]
would not hesitate[AN]
if he were here Captain Manfred[N]
would agree with me[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Young knight, your help[N]
will be precious[A][X]

## Text7Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKairs][OpenMidRight][LoadRath][OpenMidRight]
Paladin, in the name of[N]
the people of Sorya[AN]
thank you for joining us[AN]
in a seemingly impossible battle[AN]
but...the princess's wind...[AN]
is still blowing...her[N]
spirit is with us[AN]
he will come...[AN]
[CloseEyes]
I'm sure, the wind never lies[A][X]

## Text8Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKairs][OpenMidRight][LoadYala][OpenMidRight]
If only I had stayed by the princess's[N]
side until the end[AN]
[CloseEyes]
*sniff* *sniff*[AN]
maybe I could have saved her...[AN]
I...I'll be with you paladin, that's[N]
what the princess would have done[A][X]

## Text9Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKairs][OpenMidRight][LoadImperialSoldier][OpenMidRight]
On behalf of all the imperial forces[N]
that survived the crash you saved[AN]
we thank you from the bottom[N]
of our hearts...[AN]
these idiots of the[N]
4th brigade...[AN]
again muddy the name[N]
of the empire...[AN]
we would like to help you...[N]
but we are too weak...[AN]
please take our weapons, make[N]
those traitors pay![A][X]

## Text10Ch7
Supplies have been "restocked![A][X]

## Text11Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKairs][OpenMidRight][LoadBlackSmith1][OpenMidRight]
Sir Paladin, please wait![AN]
I am the blacksmith of the village you[N]
saved from the brigands a few days ago[AN]
I promised you that I would forge you[N]
a weapon worthy of your name[AN]
here it is...use it now, to protect[N]
us from these evil people![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
A very nice sword Mr. Blacksmith[N]
it will undoubtedly be very useful[A][X]

## MidText1Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBongo][OpenMidLeft]
Then? What are you doing?[AN]
Charge the Enemy! crush it![AN]
no prisoner! eliminate all them![AN]
I want the artillery in position too![N]
they must have no hope![A][X]

## MidText2Ch7
[OpenMidRight][LoadKairs][OpenMidRight]
be careful! they have placed cannons[N]
on the other side of the river![AN]
we must neutralize them[N]
as soon as possible![A][X]

## MidText3Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBongo][OpenMidRight][LoadImperialBoss][OpenMidRight]
Captain we have deployed the[N]
new artillery pieces[AN]
but we still need some time to[N]
load the bullets[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Get moving! I want those rats[N]
submerged by our shots![A][X]

## MidText4Ch7
[OpenFarLeft][LoadKushana][OpenLeft][LoadNausicaa][OpenRight][LoadHarken][OpenFarRight][LoadCatherina][OpenLeft]
NO! my people are already under[N]
attack! I have to move now![AN]
[OpenRight][CloseEyes]
There are many more than I[N]
could have imagined...[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Yes, but Captain Gervaso soon will[N]
arrive with reinforcements[AN]
we just have to hold out[N]
a little longer...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
By that time it will already[N]
too late...[AN]
[OpenRight][CloseEyes]
... ... ....[AN]
It's strange to say, but I agree...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
his reinforcements won't[N]
arrive in time...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Nausica[aa], go to your people[N]
then, create a diversion[AN]
I'm going to the imperial camp...[AN]
[OpenRight]
What!?!?[AN]
Do you think we make you[N]
go like this?[A]
What if it's all your plot?[AN]
and you wanted to betray us?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
If you think this sir knight...[AN]
so kill me here, now![AN]
you have no reason to[N]
keep me alive...[AN]
but if you want to have a chance to[N]
survive, then you'll have to trust me[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Kushana...I trust your intensions...[AN]
you are free too goo[AN]
[OpenRight]
Lady Nausica[aa] I remind you that[N]
she killed your father![AN]
is one of the reasons why we are here![AN]
she only deserves death, her only usege[N]
is to employ her as a hostage[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Sir Harken, I understand[N]
your concerns[AN]
and do not think that I make[N]
this decision lightly[AN]
in depth my heart demands vengeance...[AN]
but...now I must think of the[N]
good of my people...[AN]
Kushana, I’ll trust your plan...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
I don't cease to amaze of your[N]
behavior Nausica[aa][AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
I don’t want the valiant knights of[N]
the empire to die[AN]
for the ambitions of a madman...[AN]
it would be ideal to be able to throw[N]
the squadron commander out of the game[AN]
and I know who can help us[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
... ... ...[AN]
I... Nausica[aa] I trust your[N]
choice...we’ll stay with you[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Don’t worry, Alistarian, we[N]
have a common goal[A][X]

## MidText5Ch7

[OpenRight][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
Looks like it’s time to return to[N]
fight Imperial scum[AN]
Nausica[aa], Lady Catherina and I[N]
are at your side[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Nausica[aa], you saved our lives...[AN]
without asking for anything in return[N]
and now that we repay this debt[AN]
[OpenRight]
And so far it’s about[N]
fighting Imperial[AN]
I and my squad can continue until[N]
the end of our days![A][X]

## MidText6Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPriscilla][OpenMidLeft]
Wow, those are imperial canons![AN]
They can shoot me down very easily![AN]
We need to focus on neutralizing them![A][X]

## MidText7Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBongo][OpenMidLeft]
and so the queen of rats[N]
is still alive...[AN]
Charge men! I want everyone ready[N]
to take it down![AN]
Now!!![A][X]

## MidText8Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBongo][OpenMidLeft]
Filthy rats![AN]
why are they still alive?[AN]
are you or not great loyal[N]
soldiers of the emperor?[AN]

everything we have![A][X]

## MidText9Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBongo][OpenMidRight][LoadImperialSoldier][OpenMidRight]

With pleasure Boss![A][X]

## EndText2Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCatherina][OpenMidRight][LoadHarken][OpenMidLeft]

Still no sign of Kushana...Harken we[N]

## EndText3Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBongo][OpenMidRight][LoadImperialBoss]
Captain! Troops of Alistar[N]
on our left flank![AN]
Should we withdraw?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Call Manfred’s rear immediately![AN]
That imbecile did't want to[N]
fight against the peasants[AN]
but he can't refuse to fight against[N]
the forces of Alistar![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
But my commander, the troops are[N]
no longer motivated![AN]
We can’t do so much anymore...[A][X]

## EndText4Ch7
[OpenFarLeft][LoadManfred][OpenLeft][LoadKushana]
Loyal soldiers of the empire![AN]
Respond to my command![AN]
Withdraw immediately, do not[N]
engage in battle![AN]
Those who don't follow[N]
my orders[AN]
will be considered traitors[N]
of the homeland![AN]
Manfred, Zechiel follow me, let’s[N]
solve this problem once and for all![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
With pleasure your highness![AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadZechiel][OpenMidRight]
The forces of Alistar and[N]
the local rebels?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
The inhabitants of these lands are our[N]
allies, the knights of Alistar...[AN]
[CloseEyes]
it will all depend on[N]
their actions...[A][X]

## EndText5Ch7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNausicaa]
It’s Kushana! He’s pulling out[N]
most of the imperial forces![AN]
I have to get to her soon![A][X]

## EndText6Ch7
[OpenRight][LoadGervaso][OpenFarRight][LoadAlistarWarrior][OpenFarRight]
Boss! the Imperial forces[N]
are retreating![AN]
[OpenRight]
What! cowards, men chasing[N]
after them![AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadCatherina][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]
Captain Gervaso! stop the[N]
attack, immediately![AN]
[OpenRight]
My Lady, What the hell[N]
are you saying![AN]
It’s our last chance to defeat[N]
the empire in these lands![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I would agree, but, we have an[N]
agreement to respect[AN]
There’s still a chance we can[N]
end this feud with a peace[AN]
[OpenRight]
Peace? For me there will be peace[N]
when I have avenged every boy[AN]
who died for the Republic![AN]
Step aside, my lady[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I’m sorry to get to this point,[N]
but captain.... I remind you...[AN]
that your mission was to save me,[N]
certainly not engage a open battle[AN]
with Imperial forces violating[N]
treaties between our nations...[AN]
f you do not do what I ask[AN]
in the court of the reppublic you[N]
will lose my support...[AN]
[OpenRight][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft]
Please Commander, I’m doing this[N]
for the good of the reppublic[AN]
[OpenRight]
Well...it seems I don’t have much[N]
choice, I will follow your command...[AN]

just for the sake of my boys[A][X]

Kushana?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Nausica[aa], now that Alistar’s[N]
forces have arrived[AN]
What will you decide to do? [AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Princess Kushana, I don’t understand[N]
the purpose of this question[AN]
I thought we had a common goal...[AN]
[OpenRight]
... ... ...[AN]
Will you go away? Isn't it true?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Imperial law is too complex...[AN]
I can’t take the whole army[N]
and march on Slayder[AN]
the only thing I can do is give a[N]
general retreat order[AN]
to all the assigned forces[AN]
those who will not follow these orders[N]
will be labeled as deserters[AN]
but I can’t go after every[N]
single deserter[AN]
more so than the army of[N]
Alistar arrived here[AN]
their claims to these lands[AN]
My presence will only[N]
create another war...[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
As representative of the Republic[AN]
I deny these stupid accusations![N]
Alistar doesn’t want this land![AN]
[OpenLeft]
Catherina, our misfortune[AN]
is not to be in charge of everything[N]
in our countries[AN]
Do you think senators would approve[N]
joint operations with Imperial forces?[AN]
Do you think they will abandon[N]
their claims to these lands?[AN]
don't deny, men's hearts are the[N]
same in all parts of the world[AN]
I know my father's stupidity well, it's[N]
the same as the Alistar senate...[AN]
I don't want this land to become[N]
the pretense for a new war[AN]
between our countries[AN]
Catherina, pull Alistar’s forces[N]
back, as I will with my...[AN]
is in the common interest[AN]

I can’t give you official help...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Queen of this valley,[AN]
I'm Captain Manfred of the[N]
armored cavalry division[AN]
I will join you under the banner of an[N]
army of liberation of this valley[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
liberation army?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
I can’t give you an official help...[N]
but if you lead an independent army[AN]
I can give you some "secret help"[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Me and a small group of volunteers[N]
will join you lady Nausica[aa][AN]
I also recovered some supplies,[N]
use them at best[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Remember our little secret Nausica[aa],[AN]
the empire has not helped you[N]
officially today,[AN]
avoid the same from Alistar[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I don’t fully understand your[N]
motives for your actions...[AN]
and I cannot forgive you completely[N]
from what the empire has done...[AN]
but the actions of today, make you[N]
honor imperial princess[AN]
[OpenLeft]
You are a very interesting person[N]

you to reconsider![AN]
my troops are ready for battle![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Captain Gervaso...thank you for your[N]
help, but I’ve decided...[AN]
Alistar’s forces must withdraw[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
My lady, shall we return[N]
to Alistar?[AN]
I thought we’d stay to[N]
fight the empire...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadNausicaa][OpenFarLeft]
Empire forces are retreating[N]
from the valley[AN]
those who remain here[N]
are only deserters[AN]
the task of driving out these outlaws[N]
is mine, and the army of my people[AN]
not of Alistar or empire...[AN]
I don’t want that just because[N]
someone used his army[AN]
someone feels they have the right to[N]
reclaim these lands as their own[AN]
they belong to the people of Sorya and[N]
to the inhabitants of the valley![AN]
from the birth of the world![AN]

What an insolent girl![AN]
reject an alliance with Alistar![AN]
do as you wish[AN]
I’ve already lost too many good boys for[N]
