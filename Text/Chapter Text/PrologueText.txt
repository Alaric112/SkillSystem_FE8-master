## Introduzione 
It is said that the origins of our[NL]
world: Vainqueur, come in truth[AN]
from the ashes of the world[N] 
of our ancestors[AN]
the high angels, the first children[NL] 
of the Mother Goddess[AN]
Legend has it that the angels built[AN]
an extremely advanced civilization[AN]
to be able to travel among the stars[AN]
see the other planes of creation[AN]
were the purest essence of the Goddess[AN]
yet so perfect...they fell[NL]
into oblivion...[AN]
beings as beautiful as they can[NL]
dazzle our eyes...[AN]
their wisdom surpasses[NL]
that of all our great sages[AN]
but it was the arrogance of being able to[NL]
replace the Goddess, mother of life itself[AN]
to bring them to ruin...[AN]
a war breaks out...between whom[NL]
defended the Goddess[AN] 
and whoever wanted to kill her[A][X]

## Introduzione2
The fallen angels to face[N]
the armies of the Goddess[AN]
they built eight gigantic titans[N] 
of immeasurable power.[AN]
Their power source was the same[N]
flow of life: the ether[AN]
the war lasts for many years..[N]
in the end... there was nothing left...[AN]
the Angels died...and the Goddess[N]
was mortally wounded[A][X]

## Introduzione3
In the last moments of Life the[N]
Godess decided to donate the little[AN]
vital force that remained at[N]
now devastated lands[AN]
life begins to flourish again...[N] 
the mankind was born[AN]
the land we inhabit[N]
had begun to take shape[AN]
but the wounds of battle with[N]
the great titatini[AN]
caused a "disease"[AN]
to our land...[N] 
the world was unstable[AN]
the ether was slowly disappearing[AN]
one day life would be[N]
disappeared again[AN]
is the process of desertification[AN]
that weNwe all know.[AN]
but at the same time...[AN]
in the centers of this disease...[N]
strange structures grew[AN]
strange trees... unnatural...life[N]
came back... but not as before...[AN]
it was the plague of demons...[AN]
creatures filled with ether[AN]
dangerous and harmful[AN]
...our world was divided[AN]
... at the heart of ours[AN]
earth rises the tree of evil[AN]
and the largest toxic jungle[AN]
... a forbidden place[AN]
where only the fools[AN]
dare to venture...[AN]
these forests are said to be in[N]
truth the bones of the great titans[AN]
and the demons the grudge of[N]
fallen angels.[AN]
But men are strong...[N]
tenacious, courageous[AN]
we built ours[N]
flourishing civilization.[AN]
The largest are to the north[N]
of the great tree of evil[AN]
the millennial empire of Granorg[AN]
that survives thanks to[N]
it's metal contraptions[AN]
in particular thanks to his[N]
famous flying ships[AN]
The Republic of Alistar flourishes[N]
with a high development of magic[AN]
a technique innate to many men who[N]
allows the manipulation of the ether[AN]
But because of desertification[N]
these great nations have given themselves[AN]
and they keep fighting for[N]
the conquest of new territories[AN]
in the last hundred years an armistice[N]
between these nations allows[AN]
colonization of new[NL] 
unexplored lands[AN]
in particular they turn[N]
to overseas[AN]
but especially south of the big tree[AN]
where the moors seem almost[N]
untouched by desertification[AN]
and from the plague of demons[AN]
a sort of earthly paradise[AN]
but these lands present[N]
formerly indigenous peoples,[AN]
infinitely less powerful[AN]
of the great nations[AN]
with an isolationist policy[AN]
towards the culutre outside[N]
of their immense valley[AN]
called by all: Valley of the wind[AN]
and here is the story of redemption[N]
of our world begins[AN]
from the legend of a simple[AN]
girl, daughter of the leader[N] 
of the people of Sorya[AN]
than the five legends[N]
can start![A][X]
