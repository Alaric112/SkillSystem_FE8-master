## PrologueObjective ^
Help the caravan![X]

## Introduzione 
It is said that the origins of our[NL]
world: Vainqueur, come in truth[AN]
from the ashes of the world[N]
of our ancestors[AN]
the high angels, the first children[NL]
of the Mother Goddess[AN]
Legend has it that the angels built[AN]
an extremely advanced civilization[AN]
to be able to travel among the stars[AN]
see the other planes of creation[AN]
were the purest essence of the Goddess[AN]
yet so perfect...they fell[NL]
into oblivion...[AN]
beings as beautiful as they can[NL]
dazzle our eyes...[AN]
their wisdom surpasses[NL]
that of all our great sages[AN]
but it was the arrogance of being able to[NL]
replace the Goddess, mother of life itself[AN]
to bring them to ruin...[AN]
a war breaks out...between whom[NL]
defended the Goddess[AN]
and whoever wanted to kill her[A][X]

## Introduzione2
The fallen angels to face[N]
the armies of the Goddess[AN]
they built eight gigantic titans[N]
of immeasurable power...[AN]
Their power source was the same[N]
flow of life: the ether[AN]
the war lasts for many years...[N]
in the end... there was nothing left...[AN]
the Angels died...and the Goddess[N]
was mortally wounded[A][X]

## Introduzione3
In the last moments of Life the[N]
Godess decided to donate the little[AN]
vital force that remained at[N]
now devastated lands[AN]
life begins to flourish again...[N]
the mankind was born[AN]
the land we inhabit[N]
had begun to take shape[AN]
but the wounds of battle with[N]
the great titans[AN]
caused a great "disease"[AN]
to our land...[N]
the world was unstable[AN]
the ether was slowly disappearing[AN]
one day life would be[N]
disappeared again[AN]
is the process of desertification[AN]
that weNwe all know.[AN]
but at the same time...[AN]
in the centers of this disease...[N]
strange structures grew[AN]
strange trees...unnatural...life[N]
came back... but not as before...[AN]
it was the plague of demons...[AN]
creatures filled with ether[AN]
dangerous and harmful[AN]
...our world was divided[AN]
at the heart of ours[AN]
earth rises the tree of evil[AN]
and the largest toxic jungle[AN]
...a forbidden place[AN]
where only the fools[AN]
dare to venture...[AN]
these forests are said to be in[N]
truth the bones of the great titans[AN]
and the demons the grudge of[N]
fallen angels.[AN]
But men are strong...[N]
tenacious, courageous[AN]
we built ours[N]
flourishing civilization.[AN]
The largest are to the north[N]
of the great tree of evil[AN]
the millennial empire of Granorg[AN]
that survives thanks to[N]
it's metal contraptions[AN]
in particular thanks to his[N]
famous flying ships[AN]
The republic of Alistar flourishes[N]
with a high development of magic[AN]
a technique, innate to[N]
many men who[AN]
allows the manipulation[N]
of the ether[AN]
but because of desertification[N]
these great nations[AN]
have given themselves[N]
and they keep fighting for[AN]
the conquest of new territories[AN]
in the last hundred years an armistice[N]
between these nations allows[AN]
colonization of new[NL] 
unexplored lands[AN]
in particular they turn[N]
to overseas[AN]
but especially south of the big tree[AN]
where the moors seem almost[N]
untouched by desertification[AN]
and from the plague of demons[AN]
a sort of earthly paradise[AN]
but these lands present[N]
formerly indigenous peoples,[AN]
infinitely less powerful[AN]
of the great nations[AN]
with an isolationist policy[AN]
towards the culutre outside[N]
of their immense valley[AN]
called by all: Valley of the wind[AN]
and here is the story of redemption[N]
of our world begins[AN]
from the legend of a simple[AN]
girl, daughter of the leader[N]
of the people of Sorya[AN]
than the five legends[N]
can start![A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[N]
Yawn![AN]
I must have fallen[N] 
asleep again...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
If my father found out...[AN]
I fall asleep in the[N]
middle of a forest[AN]
He would never let me see[N]
the light of day![AN]
[CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
to think about it...I always[N]
have the same strange dream...[AN]
always the same thing...a red sky...[AN]
engulfed in flames...[AN]
Oh! stop thinking about dreams![AN]
I have to take the horn sample[N]
for the wise Salem[AN]
and get back to town quickly...before[N]
my father be mad again![A][X]

[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x5A][0x1][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x5C][0x1][OpenRight]
Oh no !, no! no![AN]
Demons! everywhere![AN]

[OpenFarRight]
We are completely surrounded![AN]
we have no hope![AN]

[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x62][0x1][OpenFarRight]
I don't want to die in[N]
this stupid forest![AN]
not torn apart by some monster![A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x5C][0x1][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x06][0x1][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x04][0x1][OpenLeft]
Calm down! your screams will only[N]
attract more demons![AN]
[OpenRight]
Right![AN]
we have nothing to fear![AN]
we have the legendary[N] 
paladin Kairs with us![AN]
in his life he will have vanquished[N]
countless foes![AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
Stay behind me![AN]
I promise we'll all get[N]
out alive![A][X]

## Text3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x06][0x1][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x04][0x1][OpenMidLeft]
I was missing some action![AN]
I can finally unsheath[N]
my new sword![AN]
[OpenRight]
Calm down boy, this isn't[N]
a workout[AN]
these creatures also fight[N]
for their survival like us[AN]
and for this they are capable[N]
of doing anything![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Come on grandpa! you know well[N]
that I am capable with the sword![AN]
I learned from the best! or you want[N]
say that with your age you have softened?[AN]
[OpenRight]
Gadriel stay by the side[N]
of the caravan![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
But I want to fight at[N]
your side![AN]
[OpenRight]
Listen to me young![AN]
There will be a time when you have[N]
to get by on your own[AN]
but this is not the day[AN]
I need someone to watch over[N]
the caravan[AN]
I don't want them to hit us[N]
behind![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Okay, you won...as usual[A][X]

## Text4
[OpenMidRight][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidRight]
A caravan of merchants?[AN]
here?[AN]
moreover attacked by demons![AN]
I have never seen angry demons in[N]
this part of the forest![AN]
it doesn't matter![AN]
I have to go to rescue them, they[N]
are completely surrounded![A][X]

## FirstTalk
[OpenFarLeft][LoadGadriel][OpenLeft][LoadKairs][OpenMidRight][LoadNausicaa][OpenLeft]
I don't believe my eyes![AN]
Nausica[aa] what are you doing here![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Kairs? it's really you![AN]
I should have guessed it![AN]
all the few caravans that[N]
pass for here[AN]
are always under your protection[AN]
[OpenLeft]
It fills my heart with joy[N] 
to see you again[AN]
but why do you find yourself alone[N]
in this forest?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Let's say I'm here[N]
for a research...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
certainly not authorized[N]
from your father...[AN]
I can imagine his anger,[N]
very well...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, but it's good thing[N]
that now I'm here![AN]
I can give you a hand to[N]
get out of the forest[A][X]

## Text5
[OpenFarLeft][LoadNausicaa]
That's the fastest way[N]
to get out of the forest![A][X]

## Text6
[OpenFarLeft][LoadGadriel][OpenLeft][LoadKairs][OpenMidRight][LoadNausicaa][OpenFarLeft]
One moment! can I understand[N]
who is this girl?[AN]
do you know Grandpa?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
My boy, her father is a[N]
my great old friend[AN]
a friend I haven't seen since[N]
two years[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Nausica[aa]? right?[N]
do you know these lands well?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Of course I know them![AN]
otherwise I wouldn't be[N]
the daughter of king of Sorya![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Sorya? but it's[N]
our destination![AN]
or am I wrong grandpa?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
No Gadriel you're not wrong[AN]
it's the destination of the caravan[AN]
financed by the king of Sorya himself[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
So this girl is[N]
the princess?!?[A]
I apologize for my informal[N]
attitude, I didn't think...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Princess, not princess, is[N] 
same thing for me[AN]
it bothers me when people[N]
they treat me differently[AN]
when they discover my rank[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Ah! then I apologize again[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Ah! ah! ah! ah! ah![AN]
why did you turned red[N]
like a pepper?[AN]
you're really funny[AN]
however it is worth talking[N]
later, we have a caravan to escort![AN]
[OpenLeft]
I agree, let's move, other[N] 
demons will soon arrive[A][X]

## Escape
Escape!!![X]

## EscapeConvoyDesc
Escape with the convoy![X]

## PrologueTurnEnemy1
[OpenMidRight][LoadKairs][OpenMidRight]
Watch out, Gadriel![N]
here they charge![A][X]

## PrologueTurnNPC1
[OpenMidRight][LoadKairs][OpenMidRight]
it's time to move on[N]
to our counter-attack![AN]
look boy, how[N]
you should really fight![A][X]

## PrologueTurn2
[OpenMidRight][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidRight]
One moment...[AN]
That paladin...[AN]
it seems to me[N]
to know him[AN]
I have to go and[N]
talk to him![A][X]

## PrologueTutorialTalk
Now that you select Naussicaa[AN]
you will notice that one has appeared[N]
small cartoon on the Paladin icon[AN]
it means that Nausicaa can interact[N]
with that character![AN]
give it a try! and see what happened![A][X]

## PrologueTurn3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKairs][OpenMidLeft]
watch out! others demons[N]
are arriving![AN]
we have to move before we get[N]
surrounded again![A][X]

## PrologueTurn4
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x04][0x01][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x06][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x02][0x01][OpenLeft]
Damn demons![AN]
they blocked the bridge![AN]
Nausica[aa], there is another way[N]
to get out of the forest?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, but we have to go back...[N]
and it will take too long[AN]
I propose another idea for[N]
cross the river[A][X]
 
## PrologueTurn4x2
[OpenLeft][LoadKairs][OpenFarLeft][LoadGadriel][OpenMidRight][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidRight]
We can take down that[N]
old tree trunk[AN]
and be able to use it[N]
as a bridge![A][X]


## PrologueTurn4x3
[OpenLeft][LoadKairs][OpenFarLeft][LoadGadriel][OpenMidRight][LoadNausicaa]
[OpenFarLeft]
It's a brilliant idea![AN]
[OpenLeft]
We can try[AN]
but we have no time to waste![N]
let's continue moving![A][X]

## PrologueEndText1
[OpenFarLeft][LoadGadriel][OpenLeft][LoadKairs][OpenMidRight][LoadNausicaa][OpenLeft]
So Nausica[aa], what do you[N]
want tell me?[AN]
I haven't seen this beautiful[N]
valley for too long...[AN]
If I think of the good times...[AN]
To think about the hunting[N]
competitions I had with your father[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Come on old man![AN]
Do you have to get nostalgic[N]
right now?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
When you are the same[N]
age as me Gadriel[AN]
you will understand the[N]
importance of memories![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Ok, but think about the present too![AN]
are we here now? I think that you will[N]
want to see your friend again![AN]
[OpenLeft]
By the way Nausica[aa][AN]
how is your old man?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
... ... ....[AN]
[OpenEyes]
so and so[AN]
is seriously ill...[AN]
[OpenLeft]... .... ....[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]... .... ....[A]
[OpenMidRight]
The elder is trying to[N]
cure him in all ways[AN]
but it seems that it isn't[N]
destined to heal[AN]
for this reason he wants that[N]
I'm locked up in the castle all day[AN]
for fears that our people[N]
will not have a guide...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Then the anger he's feeling[AN]
in this moment...[AN]
in knowing that you ran away it will be[N]
much greater than I thought before[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Grandpa![AN]
if it weren't for Nausica[aa][N]
by now we would be food for demons![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Mine was just a thought, Gadriel[AN]
I didn't want to make[N] 
Nausica[aa] feel guilty[AN]
changing the subject, which is better[AN]
Nausica[aa] what are these yours[N]
researches?[AN]
are they very important?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
.. ... ...[AN]
I'm looking for samples of some[N]
new medicinal herbs for the wise Salem[AN]
which is looking a cure[N]
for my father[AN]
[OpenLeft]
... ... ...[AN][ToggleSmile]
you really care about your father[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Seen old man with a heart of stone![AN]
Nausica[aa] disobeys for the[N]
good of his father![AN]
[OpenLeft]
I never said this Gadriel![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
you two are really funnny[N]
when you fight[AN]
however, don't worry[AN]
I know I'm wrong, but I feel[N]
in duty to do so[AN]
and to tell the truth...[AN]
I've never seen fierce demons on[N]
this side of the forest[AN]
you must have attracted them...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
demons are territorial creatures[AN]
I wonder then why they found[N]
themselves here[AN]
and what we did to annoy them...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Lately I have often seen demons, but[N]
they have never attacked anyone[AN]
[OpenLeft]
What a strange mystery it is...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Mystery? but what a mystery![AN]
they saw this old man and[N]
thought it was an easy prey![AN]
[OpenLeft]
Then came, Gadriel the daredevil[N]
chickens killer to save the day...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ah ah ah ah[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
This I grant you, but next time,[N]
I will win![AN]
[OpenLeft]
You still have many brave[N]
years ahead kill hens![AN]
it won't be easy to beat[N]
these old bones![A][X]

intrepid girl![AN]
I absolutely must give you[N]
something to repay our debt[AN]
When you can can,[N]
come to the market[AN]
so I can give you an[N]
adequate reward![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Thanks a lot, but[N]
there is no need....[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Absolutely not![AN]

wants debt![AN]

Wooow![AN]
This valley is beautiful![AN]
[OpenLeft]
Although I've already seen it in[N]
my life...[AN]
it’s a joy to see it every time[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
By following this path we can[N]
get directly to the castle[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Can't wait to finish[N]
the job![AN]
I guess you can make beautiful[N]
rides in this valley![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Races are often organized[N]
in the city[AN]
why don't you try to[N]
participate, Gadriel?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
actually...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
The knights of this valley[N]
are among the best[AN]
you have no hope against[N]
them, Gadriel[AN]
you have to keep training[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You can always try, you don’t[N]
necessarily have to win[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Well boy, you can always consider[N]
your certain defeat as a test[AN]
just make sure you don't let[N] 
me do it bad figures...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
come on you two![AN]
I think I know how[N]
ride a horse![AN]
I'm not that bad![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
The important thing is to[N]
avoid the last place[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Ah ah ah ah[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
You two are terrible together[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Come on Gadriel, we were[N]
just kidding[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
If it were up to me you might as well[N]
be one of the finalists[AN]
you have talent[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
T-Thanks *gulp*[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Why did you get red again?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Ah here is the castle![AN]
Come on Gadriel let's go unload[N]
the goods[AN]
Nausica[aa] you want to go on[AN]
so you can warn your father[N]
that we have arrived[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Sure, but I think he will passes[N]
more time to scold me[AN]
than to listening[A][X]
