We’re almost at the[N]
gates of Sorya...[AN]
[OpenRight]
It seems our enemies have[N]
decided to finally face us[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
They’re more than I imagined...[AN]
How sad to see so many men of the[N]
Empire that follow the follies[AN]
of a single man...[AN]
It is an unbearable shame...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenRight]
Nausica[aa], if we can[N]
cross the river[AN]
that passes between these hills, we[N]
can directly hit the enemy commander[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
If we succeeded, many soldiers would[N]
surrender without a fight...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
It sounds like a good idea...[N]
the sooner the better![AN]
Come on wind's warriors, the people[N]
of Sorya count on us! to victory![AN]

## StartText2Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZek][OpenMidLeft]
To arms, valiant soldiers[N]
of the empire![AN]
we will not surrender to[N]
the forces of Alistar![AN]
we will die if necessary![AN]
glory to the Empire of Granorg![A][X]

## StartText3Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZek][OpenMidRight][LoadNikolai][OpenMidLeft]
Nikolai, it does you honor[N]
to stay and fight[AN]
while the others in your brigade[N]
flee from the battle[AN]
Kushana is just a vile traitor![AN]
she only think about saving her[N]
face in front of the Emperor![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I...I can’t figure out why[N]
captain Manfred escaped...[AN]
he was a true loyal knight[N]
of the empire[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
I know the captain from[N]
long time...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
and yet I cannot understand[N]
why he abandoned us...[AN]
You’re right, he was a great[N]
knight of the Empire[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Lieutenant Zek, leave the[N]
front row to me[AN]
I want to fight like[N]
Manfred was![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
It does you credit, boy...[AN]
if only all the knights of the empire[N]
had a noble heart like your...[AN]
By now, victory would be ours...[A][X]

## MidText1Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZek][OpenMidLeft]
damn I didn't expect them[N]
to reach us that fast[AN]
[CloseEyes]
I underestimated them...[N]
at this rate...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadShamanPurple][OpenMidRight]
You seem in trouble, lieutenant...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
*!!!*[AN]
What are wormhandlers doing here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
We’re here on Slayder'behalf[N]
and we give you our help[AN]
and our new weapon...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
What the...hell is that thing![AN]
I will never accept help[N]
from people like you![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Too bad...because you[N]
seemed in trouble...[AN]
I thought your loyalty to the[N]
empire was stronger...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Wait![AN]
[CloseEyes]
I...I accept your help...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Excellent...you keep busy a[N]
little more our enemies[AN]
The stone will do the rest[A][X]

## MidText2Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidLeft]
Urgh...[AN]
Aaaaahhh!!![AN]
[OpenRight][LoadCalliope][OpenFarRight][LoadKairs][OpenRight]
Nausica[aa]! what happened?[N]
are you hurt?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Nausica[aa]! Come to your senses![AN]
say what happened[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I...I don’t know...suddenly I feel[N]
my head exploding...[AN]
I hear screams...screams of[N]
uncontrolled anger...[AN]
[OpenFarRIght][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
What do these screams say?[AN]
[OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don’t understand their words...[N]
but I feel their anger...[AN]
[OpenRight]
What the hell is going[N]
on with the sky?[AN]
Look![AN]
A light went out of that hill![A][X]

## MidText3Ch8
[OpenFarLeft][LoadCatherina][OpenLeft][LoadManfred][OpenRight][LoadKairs][OpenFarRight][LoadCalliope]
[OpenLeft]
Kairs! What happened to Nausica[aa]?[AN]
[OpenRight]
I don’t know exactly...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
I feel a strange presence...[AN]
Whatever happened to her is also[N]
connected in some way[AN]
with this sudden change in the sky[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
it started when a strange ray of[N]
light started from that hill[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Watch! suddenly a huge black monolith[N]
appeared on top of the hill![AN]
[OpenFarRight][LoadNausicaa][OpenFarRight]
Kairs ... I think I understand[N]
some words of those screams[AN]
[OpenLeft]
What do they say?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
They’re angry at that[N]
black stone...[AN]
they want to destroy it![AN]
The screams...the voices...[N]
are the demons![AN]
they are trying to communicate[N]
with me[AN]
To destroy that stone, they will[N]
burn everything to the ground![AN]
We must prevent this from happening![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Are you sure about that?[AN]
Demons are evil creatures...but...[AN]
this is not their territory[N]
and it is impossible talk with them...[AN]
[OpenRight]
We must believe Nausicaa! I’m sure[N]
she’s telling the truth![AN]
[OpenLeft]
That means we have to destroy[N]
that stone first![AN]
We have no time to waste! let's move![A][X]

## MidText4Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCatherina][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
Nausicaa, you are[N]
a kind soul...[AN]
Yet in you I feel a strange[N]
presence...[AN]
I have no other choice for now...[AN]
I have to trust her, for[N]
Alistar's sake...[A][X]

## MidText5Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNikolai][OpenMidLeft]
what is happening? the[N]
sky suddenly changed[AN]
[CloseEyes]
Should I go back?[AN]
[OpenEyes]
No, I can't back away right now[AN]
But there is something[N]
strange in the air...[A][X]

## MidText6Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMercenaryGreen][OpenMidRight][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidLeft]
princess, a large number of[N]
demons are approaching![AN]
We cannot fight two fronts, must[N]
we withdraw?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
The demons are not[N]
our real enemies,[AN]
if we destroy the black[N]
stone, they will retreat[AN]
try to avoid engaging[N]
battle with them[A][X]

## MidText7Ch8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZek][OpenMidLeft]
Our lives are already marked...[AN]
let's make our last[N]
fight glorious![AN]
with me brave knights we[N]
strike the enemy![A][X]

## ManfredTalkNikolaiCh8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadManfred][OpenMidRight][LoadNikolai][OpenMidRight]
Captain Manfred?!?[AN]
I thought you abandoned us...[AN]
that you were fled with princess[N]
Kushana...but instead...[AN]
have you joined the enemy?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Nikolai, what are you doing[N]
with Slayder's forces?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
To fight the enemies[N]
of the empire![AN]
Alistar's forces have attacked us![AN]
They are ready to use anything[N]
to defeat us![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
This army is not from Alistar![AN]
I joined them to fight in[N]
the name of the Empire![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I don't understand...you are[N]
fighting for the empire...[AN]
these are not from Alistar?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Nikolai, you are a good knight[N]
rejoin me![AN]
I'm here to redeem the name of[N]
the knights of the empire[AN]
the traitor is General Slayder![AN]
He's using a mysterious stone[N]
to lure demons here![AN]
he is responsible for all of this![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
[CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
Captain, forgive me[N]
for doubting you[AN]
I will return to your[N]
ranks with pleasure![A][X]ù

## LukasTalkNikolaiCh8
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLukas][OpenMidRight][LoadNikolai][OpenMidRight]
What is a soldier of the empire[N]
doing with Alistar's army![AN]
I thought that the others were cowards[N]
and that they had run away...[AN]
but to know that there[N]
are also traitors...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
No, you're wrong![AN]
I'm not a traitor to the Empire![AN]
I'm with this army just[N]
to defend it![AN]
this army fights only to[N]
free its lands[AN]
it is not in the pay of Alistar,[N]
rather it has driven them out![AN]
