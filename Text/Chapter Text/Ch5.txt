[OpenMidRight]
Nausica[aa]? Nausica[aa]![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Calliope? where we are?[AN]
Oh...I have a strong headache[AN]
One moment...The city? The imperials?[N]
where have they all gone![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Hey, don't worry, the[N]
worst is over[AN]
now we are safe and on board[N]
an imperial airship[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
What!!![AN]
and you say we're safe![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Nausica[aa]...the artifact emitted a[N]
dazzling light...and you passed out...[AN]
[CloseEyes]
from there the paladin Kairs[N]
decided to surrender...[AN]
and Imperial Princess Eruca...[N]
she spared everyone's life...[AN]
and gave orders to help his soldiers[N]
to help the wounded...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft]
I think she meant that[N]
we are now her prisoners...[AN]
The artifact ... where is it?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
[CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
I don't know Nausica[aa]...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft]
Damn it, Salem had put me in[N]
charge of guarding it...[A][X]

Lady Nausica[aa]![AN]
[OpenRight]
Lukas?...[AN]
you tricked us...and now[N]
you are our guard?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
No...forgive me...I...[AN]
[CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
...I didn't know that an army[N]
was marching towards your city[AN]
Nausica[aa] is also thanks to Lukas[N]
that we can now talk...[AN]
it was he who convinced[N]
the Imperial princess[AN]
that we were not her enemies...[AN]
[OpenRight]
Sure! after destroying the[N]
city first![AN]
after killing my father...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lady...[AN]
you are right, you are full justified[N]
in the anger you feel towards me...[AN]
my word counts for little...but[AN] 
I ask your forgiveness in the name[N]
of all the knights of the empire...[AN]
unfortunately General Slayder made[N]
a serious mistake...[AN]
so you are not prisoners, I have only[N]
been assigned to be your escort.[AN]
Forgive me if I couldn't[N]
do enough to help...[AN]
now Princess Eruca would[N]
like to speak with you[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarRight]
Nausica[aa]...I can only imagine[N]
how you feel...[AN]
but we can't do this as long as[N]
we're aboard an Imperial airship[AN]
[OpenRight][CloseEyes]
You're right, forgive me...I better[N]
go talk this Eruca...[A][X]

Yala? what are you doing here?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Or, forgive me my lady[N]
I fell asleep...[AN]
They allowed me to come with you[AN]
you needed to heal your[N]
wounds and...I...[AN] 
Yala...thanks for being by my[N]
side, now it's my turn...[AN]

Colt?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenRight]
Always the same as I see...[AN]
but I am happy to see that[N]
you are with us[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's just Captain Mito's orders...[AN]
[OpenRight]
Is Mito on board with us?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
unfortunately I haven't seen him[N]
since we parted at the castle...[AN]
I don't know where it is ... [A]
I don't know if he's[N]
still alive...I...[AN]
[OpenRight]
The captain is strong for[N]
sure he will be safe[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I have no doubts about strength[N]
of the captain...[AN]
I doubt what traps and deceptions these[N]
imperial scoundrels can devise...[AN]
ever since we got into[N]
this hellish machine[AN]
I've been thinking of a[N]
way to escape...[AN]
[OpenRight]
thought of something?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
this damn place is too well guarded...[AN]
there are some lifeboats...[AN]
but I still don't understand[N]
how they work...[AN]
it won't be easy to leave here[A][X]

Oh oh look who came out of the[N]
fairytale world![AN]
[OpenRight]
Diana! Rosie![AN]
I am happy to see you safe and sound[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Honestly I would have preferred[N]
to finish it in battle[AN]
instead of being taken prisoner[N]
by these bastards...[AN]
[OpenRight]
As long as we're alive we won't give up[N]
on these oppressors, you have my word[AN]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
Oh yeah![AN]
these are the words[N]
I wanted to hear![AN] 
[OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]

[OpenLeft]
Come'n Diana, take heart![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][OpenEyes]
I'm too afraid...[AN]
[OpenRight]
Diana, we can't give up[N]
we must protect Sorya[AN]

Y-Yes you are right...I have[N]

## Text4Ch5
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSlayder][OpenMidRight][LoadMistero][OpenMidLeft]
Oh sir![AN] 
how pleasant is your visit![N]
you made me do a great deal![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Glad to know that you like[N]
your new conquest[AN]
and to be the next hero[N]
of the empire[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Tell me, how are the studies[N]
on the artifact proceeding?[AN]
was it worth so much effort?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh absolutely![AN] 
this is an important piece for[N]
the final victory of mankind[AN]
with this we can...[AN]

General Slayder![AN]
[OpenRight]
*!!!*[AN]
[OpenLeft]
What are you doing in here?[AN]
The guard and I are about[N]
to leave for the empire[AN]
I entrust the command to you[N]
and to Captain Manfred[AN]
Slayder...make sure you[N]
don't make any mess...[AN]
if not you will pay with your[N]
head, are we clear?[AN]
[OpenRight]
C-Certainly your Highness![N]
you can fully rely on me![AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Can I ask you a favor, your highness?[AN]
I need some imperial soldiers[N]
for some research[AN]
I'm studying the artifact that the[N]
girl had, is extremely interesting[AN]
I think it's just a piece[N]
of something bigger[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Permit granted [A]
when I get back, I want a full[N]
report from both of you![A][X]

## Text6Ch5
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSlayder][OpenMidRight][LoadMistero][OpenMidLeft]
Grr...[AN]
that impudent woman![AN]
but who does she think she is![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
... ... ...[AN]
must be a thorn in the side...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You can say it loud![AN]
she will be the ruin of the empire![N]
it's time to make her pay![AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha[AN]
I know a person who can help us[AN]
it would take a little accident,[N]
can't you find my friend?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh yes![AN]
tell me, my ears are open![A][X]

## Text7Ch5
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKushana][OpenMidRight][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidLeft]
Ah! here you are, I've[N]
been waiting for you[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
... ... ...[AN]
Why didn't you kill me?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
What reason would I have[N]
for killing you?[AN]
you surrendered to the empire[N]
now, you became my guest[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You still could have done it...[AN]
I still don't understand[N]
your intentions[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha![AN]
I believe that people are more[N]
useful alive than dead...[AN]
anyway I wanted to talk[AN]
a little with you...[N]
really strange isn't it?[AN]
your valley is so "green"...[AN]
the rest of the world is[N]
just a huge powder store[AN]
have you ever wondered?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I deduce from your silence[N]
that your answer is no[AN]
I believe instead that I have[N]
found the answer...[AN]
and resides at the center[N]
of our world[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Are you talking about the nest[N]
of evil and rotwood?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Exactly![AN]
my job is to purge that place[AN]
destroying that tree, that[N]
forest...the demons...[AN]
the world will return to its splendor[A]
[OpenMidRight]
*!!!*[AN]
how can you be so sure?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
demons exist outside the[N]
original life cycle[AN]
this means that they are[N]
the cause of our ills[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
What if they aren't?[AN]
what evidence do you[N]
have for your idea?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I hope you are joking![AN]
it is obvious that the demons[AN]
are the essence of the evil[N]
that infests our lands[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Rotwood inhabitants are living[N]
beings like everyone else[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I thought I would find a[N]
supporter of my ideas...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Even if we do not understand[AN]
the reasons for the existence of the[N]
rotwood and the demons...[AN]
I simply do not think it is right[N]
to extinguish a living being[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha[AN]
what a bizarre person you are[AN]
you remind me of the ancient insane[N]
monks of the Dorok...[A][X]

Your Highness![AN]
Unidentified airships[N]
are chasing us![AN]
[OpenLeft]
What!?![AN]
They seem to be pirates of[N]
the sea of clouds![AN]
they are trying to harpoon us![AN]
[OpenLeft]
To arms, everyone![AN]
Nausica[aa]...this is your name[AN]
How about you help me take[N]
out these pirates?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Why are you asking for my help?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
we are simply now allies, we[N]
have the same ship to defend[AN]
they won't make any difference[AN]
they will slaughter all the people[N]
aboard this ship, without mercy[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
... ... ...[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
I understand your hesitation[AN]
I understand the hatred you[N]
feel towards the empire[AN]
but for this reason I want to[N]
fight by your side[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
No Lukas, forgive me first[AN]
you don't center in this story[N]

Men are ready to attack![AN]
[OpenLeft]
Very well![AN]
remember that our target is[N]
the Imperial princess![AN]
find it at any cost![AN]
or destroy the engine room[N]
of the Imperial ship![AN]
Captain...but shouldn't we think[N]
about finding Lady Catherine?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Boy, eliminating this imperial ship[AN]
we will have free maneuver in[N]
these territories[AN]
furthermore, if we capture[N]
the Imperial princess[AN]
we would have a considerable advantage[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenRight]

## TextEnd1Ch5
[OpenFarLeft][LoadAsbel][OpenLeft][LoadGervaso][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x6C][0x1][OpenMidRight]
Captain! captain![AN]
Demons! Demons everywhere![AN]
they are destroying the ship![AN]
[OpenLeft]
Shit! stop the operation![AN]
evasive maneuver, we must not let[N]
the core of the flock reach us![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
We can't! We are still anchor[N]
to the imperial ship![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Captain! I'll go![AN]

move from here![AN]

Damn...Zechiel where did you go...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Come on! you can't lose[N]
your temper now![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
yeah ... you are right, there are[N]
lifeboats on the lower deck[AN]
but we must first unlock the command[N]
center to allow them to be activated[AN]
are you ready to risk your life?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I see no other choice, come on let's move![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Then follow me, before the demons come![A][X]

## TextEnd3Ch5
[OpenRight][LoadNausicaa][OpenFarRight][LoadKushana][OpenFarRight]
Quick! pulls that lever![AN]
well...it seems that we have barely[N]
made it, now we try to reach the[AN]
lower deck and take a rescue shawl...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAsbel][OpenMidLeft]
Look how lucky I am today![AN]
[OpenRight]
Hey! what are you doing?!?[AN]
we have to go to the lifeboats![AN]
why are you blocking our way?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
You waste your breath...this here[N]
is an Alistar soldier[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I see that the imperial viper[N]
has a good intuition[AN]
I, Asbel of pejite, at the cost[N]
of my own life![AN]
I will do justice to the atrocities[N]
committed by this monster![AN]
[OpenRight]
You won't be serious![N]
we don't have time![AN]
the ship is crashing, let's put aside[N]
the hate you have![AN]
we must save ourselves![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
you don't look like an imperial, for me[N]
you can go, but the viper stays with me[AN]
[OpenRight]
Why behave like this...[AN]
I will not leave anyone behind[AN]

forces that threaten the balance of our[N]
