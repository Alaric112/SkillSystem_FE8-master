Your Highness...our guest[N]
has returned[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, bring it here, I have[N]
some questions to ask[A][X]

## StartText2Ch9
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMistero][OpenMidRight][LoadKushana][OpenMidRight]
I was waiting for you, gentleman[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Forgive me for waiting,[N]
your highness[AN]
it took longer than expected for[N]
the fly to fall into the web[AN]
now the spider just has[N]
to do its part...[AN]
Slayder won't cause any[N]
more trouble[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Well done...how's the[N]
reserarch going?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I ran into a problem...[AN]
some of the initial assumptions[N]
turned out to be wrong...[AN]
the artifact we found[N]
is incomplete[AN]
it's just a piece of[N]
a bigger puzzle[AN]
but I was able to give a hypothesis[N]
as to where the other pieces may be[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
very well, soon the world will see[N]
the light of the new tomorrow[AN]
but before that...[AN]
I just have one last[N]
question for you...[AN]
Who ordered my assassination?[AN]
Slayder couldn't have[N]
done anything alone[AN]
was it one of my brothers?[AN]
Was it probably Salmoneus or was[N]
it the apex of evil itself?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
My lady, I beg you, I am innocent![AN]
I don't know who could have[N]
helped the general...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Shut up![AN]
don't you dare make[N]
fun of me[AN]
You think I don't know[N]
you're part of Oxus?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
!!![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
What a pathetic man[AN]
Zechiel, please remove this[N]
garbage from my ship[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You can't afford to do that![AN]
We have a deal! remember?[AN]
I'm the only one who can[N]
decipher the ancient texts...[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ah! ah! ah![AN]
Do you really think[N]
you're irreplaceable?[AN]
You were wrong to[N]
turn against me[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
The great master will punish[N]
this affront of yours![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
In the new world, there will be no[N]
need for scrap like you...[AN]
at the right time I will[N]
eradicate the evil of Oxus[AN]
but now, Zechiel deal[N]
with this rejection[A][X]

## StartText3Ch9
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKushana][OpenMidLeft]
Father...what madness led you to[N]
try to kill your own children[AN]
unleash intolerance and wars...[AN]
Father, why this?[AN]

you again as an ally...[AN]

Captain Zek has been defeated![N]
and many of our troops have fled![AN]
The enemy has conquered the city![N]
and now he's heading here![AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
I've been betrayed, I was used[N]
a treacherous trap...[AN]
But I...am the Emperor's hero![N]
the great Slayder[AN]
Men! Who do you fight for?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
General, we are soldiers of[N]
the 4th Imperial Brigade[AN]
We are loyal to the emperor who[N]
laid down his will to you[AN]
we will fight to the death for[N]
the glory of the empire[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, then we shall have[N]
a glorious end![AN]
Soldier...is the leader of the enemy[N]
the ex-princess of these lands?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
It seems to be so[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Bring me one of the hostages[AN]
I will bring all the Empire's enemies[N]

Welcome! Your name is...[AN]
Nausica[aa]..., right?[AN]
Yes, leader of this army of peasants[N]
who call themselves "wind warriors"[AN]
oh, what an unexpected guest[N]
joins our little party[AN]
Kushana's old pet, commander Manfred![AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Slayder, your mad game is over![AN]
lay down your arms and[N]
surrender immediately[AN]
maybe you'll have a chance of being[N]
tried at the imperial court...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ah! ah! ah! ah! ah![AN]
You really think I'm[N]
a weak coward?[AN]
don't you?[AN]
I'm ready to die, if that's[N]
the Emperor's will[AN]
so will my men[AN]
[OpenRight]
Why act like this? It doesn’t[N]
make sense what you say[AN]
Why would your emperor want that?[AN]
There is no need to generate[N]
more suffering[AN]
Drop your weapons,[N]
I promise I won’t...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Silence! you arrogant girl![AN]
You talk like that,[N]
show me mercy...[AN]
just because you think you[N]
have the victory in hand![AN]
But you wouldn’t be any[N]
different from me[AN]
if you found yourself[N]
in my situation![AN]
but I still have a bastion[N]
to defend...[AN]
and one last card to play with[N]
which to reverse the situation![A][X]

[OpenRight]
Lena?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][Clear][OpenMidLeft][LoadSlayder][OpenMidLeft]
Bingo![AN]
I see the child is dear to you![AN]
You can have it back only if YOU[N]
and your stupid army surrender![AN]
[OpenRight]
I will not give in to[N]
that blackmailing[AN]
If you are really a strong[N]
man, fight fair![AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Slayder, these actions are[N]
deplorable and unjustifiable![AN]
The Emperor would never dare...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Maybe you don’t understand[AN]
this is not a fairy tale![AN]
Even if I have to go to hell,[N]
I will serve my Emperor![A][X]

## StartText8Ch9
Only screams of pain resounded[N]
in the halls of Sorya Castle[AN]
ended with a strong[N]
mettalic screeching[AN]
The young princess threw her[N]
spear with all her strength[AN]
But with eyes full of tears,[N]
she misses her target[AN]
After that, a mocking[N]
laugh broke out[A][X]

## StartText9Ch9
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSlayder][OpenMidLeft]
Finally, I can see your anger![AN]
you can keep the body...[AN]
I'll wait for the battle, Nausica[aa],[N]

## StartText11Ch9
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLena][OpenMidLeft]
Big sister...I’m so cold...[N]
it’s getting... so dark...[A][Death][X]

## StartText12Ch9
After a short cry, a disturbing[N]
silence descended[AN]
Even the hardest souls were shaken[N]
by the madness of that moment[AN]
they said quietly, it is the[N]
will of the emperor...[AN]
But their looks[N]
betrayed them...[AN]
The end of the first[N]
legend was near...[A][X]

## MidText1Ch9
A primordial rage rises in the[N]
heart of the young princess[AN]
In his head only shouts of[N]
anger and pain echoed[AN]
He held his sister’s pendant[N]
with all his might[A][X]

## MidText2Ch9
[OpenMidRight][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidRight]
You’re right to run while you still[N]
can, you filthy monster![AN]
because I will make you regret coming[N]
here, you will regret having[AN]
wounded the people of Sorya[AN]
and with your blood I will allay the[N]

Today my people will finally[N]

action alongside the princess[AN]
I hope that in these[N]
days of my absence[AN]
you have continued to study...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I almost burst into tears[N]
from the commotion[AN]
And you only think[N]
about my studies?[AN]
to think I missed you...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
Mind training is not negligible[N]
to a true researcher[AN]
you must always be in[N]
search of knowledge![AN]

That being said, I’m glad you’re[N]

I would have liked to come[N]

but I was detained by[N]
our unwelcome guests[AN]
but now, I will give all myself[N]
not to fail again[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Salem...would you use your powers[N]
to drive these brutes out?[AN]
[CloseEyes]
they deserve no compassion...[AN]

the courage to speak...[AN]
just as the men of the far-off[N]
nations have come, so they go[AN]
but they are all grateful to be able[N]
to get the chance to return at home[AN]
even the remains of[N]
Slayder’s forces...[AN]

Captain, may I speak with you?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
Oh...it's you Lukas,[N]
sure tell me[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Captain...I can’t stop thinking about[N]
everything that’s happened[AN]
I wonder why it had to happen...[AN]
and what if we’re the rebels?[AN]
still now, many of them proclaim to[N]
have followed the will of the Emperor[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I wonder the same things, boy...[AN]
I don’t know who to[N]
trust anymore...[AN]
it’s like Laurentia’s war[AN]
the truth will be covered up, and the[N]
real culprits will be masked...[AN]
[CloseEyes]
What’s the point of[N]
continuing this?[AN]
[OpenEyes]
you still have the chance to go[N]
back, no one would blame you[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I decided to become a knight...[AN]
to have the opportunity to[N]
protect the weakest[AN]
If I flee now...how can[N]
I continue my goal?[AN]
even if it means opposing[N]
the Emperor himself...I...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
is the determination of[N]
you young people...[AN]
who give me a reason[N]
to continue fighting[AN]
to create a better future...[AN]
even if it means crossing a[N]
river of mud and blood[AN]
Thanks you, boy, for[N]
making me remember[AN]
don’t let this unjust[N]
world change you[AN]
continue your dreams![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][Clear][OpenMidRight]
Captain...but I...I want to help[N]
you, I was weak, and I remain weak[AN]
I’ve always relied on you...[AN]
how pathetic I am...[A][X]

Even the sky wept the loss of the[N]
brave sons of the wind's valley[AN]
because they were called too soon...[AN]
sacred songs were sung[N]
in their honor[AN]
and finally came a cold silence[AN]

It was the song used...[AN]
during the coronation of the[N]
ancient kings of Sorya[AN]
Then many others began to[N]
sing those joyful rhymes[AN]
that day was crowned the[N]
youngest queen of Sorya[AN]
She was the last light[N]
in the shadow[AN]
a last source of hope where[N]
there was none[AN]
now the survivors were the young[N]
queen’s last guiding light...[AN]
the paladin's words[N]
echoed in her mind[AN]
The hard mantle of responsibility[N]
belongs to the survivors[AN]
while bursting into tears[AN]
she accepted the hard task[AN]
and wore the small crown of[N]
