*coff* Kairs!? *coff*[AN]
are really you? was from a[N]
year we didn't see each other![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
O my frind! to be precise[AN]
it's been two years since[N]
I set foot in the valley [AN]
[OpenRight]
Oh! this only increases[N]
the joy of seeing you again![AN]
*coff* *coff*[AN]
I missed your company[AN]
*coff* *coff*[AN]
unfortunately it happened[N]
many things in this time frame[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Nausica[aa] told me about it[N]
on the way back[AN]
what a bad disease, have[N] 
you caught, my old friend?[AN]
[OpenRight]... ... ...[AN]
I think I have little left[N]
to live by now[AN]
*coff* *coff*[AN]
fate wants me[N]
leave this world[AN]
*coff* the disease *coff* is incurable[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
I'm sorry...really sorry...[AN]
I should have stayed here...[AN]
I come back...and I see my great friend[AN]
who saves my life...[AN]
and I...helpless...[AN]
[OpenRight]
*coff* *coff* don't say[N]
these things Kairs! *coff*[AN]
I'm happy to see you again[AN]
tell me did you meet this[N]
makes trouble on the road[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
My friend[AN]
if it weren't for Nausica[aa][N]
we would never get here[AN]
[OpenRight]
What happened?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
On the way to the city[AN]
we passed for the old[N]
north grove[AN]
I sure remembered that way[AN]
instead we entered in full[N]
territory of a demons[AN]
[OpenRight]Demons!?![AN]
in the valley!?! *coff* *coff*[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Yes my friend[AN]
a large herd[N]
of demons attacked us[AN]
we had little hope, we were[N]
lost in the forest[AN]
and cast out by these demons[AN]
suddenly your daughter, Nausica[aa][AN]
emerged from the foliage of the forest[AN]
mowed down our assailants and[N]
led us out of the forest[AN]
[OpenRight]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Don't be too hard on her[AN]
He may have disobeyed you but he has[N]
saved my life[AN]
that of my nephew Gadriel and everyone[N]
the other members of the caravan[AN]
[OpenRight]
... ... ...[AN]
*coff* know you were alone in[N]
a forest fighting demons[AN]
it still makes me *coff* more furious[AN]
*coff* *coff*[AN]
... ... ...[AN]
Nausica[aa] I must admit you that[N]
you have grown up...[AN]
you saved Kairs's life and[N]
the members of the caravan[AN]
if instead you have followed[N]
my order, and to stay inside the city walls[AN]
.... ... ...[AN]
Nausica[aa], forgive me, but before[N]
leave you there[AN]
make sure you and Lena are safe[AN]
but I can't keep you under forever[N]
my protective wing[AN]
You are the next ruler of[N]
this valley[AN]
and as my heir you must[N]
also learn the task[AN]
that a good king must do[AN]
you have to learn to defend the[N]
our people[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Enough now, Father![AN]
don't talk as if there[N]
death was around the corner![AN]
[OpenRight]
Instead it is![AN]
I don't know if it will be if[N] 
the Goddess wants[AN] 
it that I'm going back to her[AN]
tomorrow, in a month, a year[N]
I don't know[AN]
*coff* *coff* but it's close[N]
I feel it! *coff* *coff*[AN]
Gilliam what was the problem[N]
that you raised me earlier?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
My lord, we have received[N]
a request for help[AN]
by some peasants of the[N]
north valley...[AN]
a group of shady people do[N]
wanders around there[AN]
they seem to be bandits[N]
and thieves[AN]
I learned that last night[N]
they burned some farms[AN]
we must act as soon as possible[AN]
[OpenRight]Well *coff* *coff*[AN]
Nausica[aa] I entrust you with the task[N]
to drive these bandits from our lands[AN]
I would do it myself if I still had[N]
the forces in the body[AN]
you will be accompanied by Captain[N] 
Gilliam and his team[AN]
My old kairs[AN]
how long do you plan to stay?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
I already know what you[N] 
are me to ask[AN]
as long as I stay here[N] 
I will help Nausica[aa] as best I can[AN]
[OpenRight]*coff* *coff*[AN]
thanks, really thanks[N]
my friend[AN]
you will be well paid for this job[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Don't worry about these[N]
nonsense, I don't want a coin from you[AN]
I would like a room instead[N]
for me and my nephew[AN]
and a good hot meal[AN]
[OpenRight]*coff* for you *coff*[N]
this and more! my old friend![AN]
Nausica[aa] do you agree with my idea?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Yes father[AN]
[OpenRight]
I recommend you, my daughter, to follow[N]
Gillian's advice[AN]
he is a brave knight, with[N]
he and Kairs, you will be safe[AN]
*coff* *coff*[AN]
[OpenFarRight]My Lady I recommend you[N]
to start preparing[AN]
we will leave tomorrow at dawn[AN]
to be able to return[N]
in the evening[AN]
[OpenRight]

Elder, tell me[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm sorry ... your father[N]
does not do it out of malice[AN]
he just wants to protect you[N]
and your sister[AN]
... ... ...[AN]
why don't you tell him the[N]
truth: you are gone[AN]
to look for medicinal herbs[N]
to ease his pain[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You know how it is done...[AN]
he would get even more angry if[N]
he discovers that I risk my life for him[AN]
especially after all his[N]
defeatist speeches...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Maybe you are right...but[N]
I feel guilty for not having taken...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Elder, please, I don't try[N]
resentment towards anyone[AN]
you have helped me countless times[AN]
don't worry about these nonsense[AN]
Did you see Master Salem sooner?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Actually, it's been this morning[N]
that I don't see it[AN]
you have to try to ask[N]
to his apprentice[AN]
stands at the east intersection[AN]
he will probably know where[N]
it is found at[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you so much elder[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Not at all! little one[AN]

*sniff* Big sister!!![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lena? why are you crying?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Why did you run away! I had[N]
so afraid of losing you![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lena, I didn't run away, I was[N]
performing a task[AN]
I would be back as soon as I finished[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Don't tell lies![AN]
Dad hadn't given you any[N]
mission! you wanted to leave us![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Don't say this nonsense![AN]
I don't want to leave you or anyone[N]
of the valley[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I was so afraid, afraid of[N]
lose you forever...[AN]
since you go out alone, I had[N]
a nightmare[AN]
that you would never come back to us[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
It was just a bad dream Lena[AN]
I will always come back to you and[N] 
from Dad to help you[AN]
I promise that I will always remain close to you[AN]
you don't have to worry[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
*sniff*I trust you sister...[AN]

me this new book?[AN]

he's really a weird man...[AN]
it's always in there ... among the books...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You can rest assured that[N]
I'll be back, and yes...[AN]
I read you this new book[AN]
just don't fall asleep[N]

[OpenMidRight]
