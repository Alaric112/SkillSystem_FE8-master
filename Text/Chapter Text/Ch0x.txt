year we didn't see each other![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
O my frind! to be precise[AN]
it's been two years since[N]
I set foot in the valley [AN]
[OpenRight]
Oh! this only increases[N]
the joy of seeing you again![AN]
*coff* *coff*[AN]
I missed your company[AN]
*coff* *coff*[AN]
unfortunately it happened[N]
many things in this time frame[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Nausica[aa] told me about it[N]
on the way back[AN]
what a bad disease, have[N] 
you caught, my old friend?[AN]
[OpenRight]... ... ...[AN]
I think I have little left[N]
to live by now[AN]
*coff* *coff*[AN]
fate wants me[N]
leave this world[AN]
*coff* the disease *coff* is incurable[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
I'm sorry...really sorry...[AN]
I should have stayed here...[AN]
I come back...and I see my great friend[AN]
who saves my life...[AN]
and I...helpless...[AN]
[OpenRight]
*coff* *coff* don't say[N]
these things Kairs! *coff*[AN]
I'm happy to see you again[AN]
tell me did you meet this[N]
makes trouble on the road[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
My friend[AN]
if it weren't for Nausica[aa][N]
we would never get here[AN]
[OpenRight]
What happened?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
On the way to the city[AN]
we passed for the old[N]
north grove[AN]
I sure remembered that way[AN]
instead we entered in full[N]
territory of a demons[AN]
[OpenRight]Demons!?![AN]
in the valley!?! *coff* *coff*[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Yes my friend[AN]
a large herd[N]
of demons attacked us[AN]
we had little hope, we were[N]
lost in the forest[AN]
and cast out by these demons[AN]
suddenly your daughter, Nausica[aa][AN]
emerged from the foliage of the forest[AN]
mowed down our assailants and[N]
led us out of the forest[AN]
[OpenRight]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Don't be too hard on her[AN]
He may have disobeyed you but he has[N]
saved my life[AN]
that of my nephew Gadriel and everyone[N]
the other members of the caravan[AN]
[OpenRight]
... ... ...[AN]
*coff* know you were alone in[N]
a forest fighting demons[AN]
it still makes me *coff* more furious[AN]
*coff* *coff*[AN]
... ... ...[AN]
Nausica[aa] I must admit you that[N]
you have grown up...[AN]
you saved Kairs's life and[N]
the members of the caravan[AN]
if instead you have followed[N]
my order, and to stay inside the city walls[AN]
.... ... ...[AN]
Nausica[aa], forgive me, but before[N]
leave you there[AN]
make sure you and Lena are safe[AN]
but I can't keep you under forever[N]
my protective wing[AN]
You are the next ruler of[N]
this valley[AN]
and as my heir you must[N]
also learn the task[AN]
that a good king must do[AN]
you have to learn to defend the[N]
our people[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Enough now, Father![AN]
don't talk as if there[N]
death was around the corner![AN]
[OpenRight]
Instead it is![AN]
I don't know if it will be if[N] 
the Goddess wants[AN] 
it that I'm going back to her[AN]
tomorrow, in a month, a year[N]
I don't know[AN]
*coff* *coff* but it's close[N]
I feel it! *coff* *coff*[AN]
Gilliam what was the problem[N]
that you raised me earlier?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
My lord, we have received[N]
a request for help[AN]
by some peasants of the[N]
north valley...[AN]
a group of shady people do[N]
wanders around there[AN]
they seem to be bandits[N]
and thieves[AN]
I learned that last night[N]
they burned some farms[AN]
we must act as soon as possible[AN]
[OpenRight]Well *coff* *coff*[AN]
Nausica[aa] I entrust you with the task[N]
to drive these bandits from our lands[AN]
I would do it myself if I still had[N]
the forces in the body[AN]
you will be accompanied by Captain[N] 
Gilliam and his team[AN]
My old kairs[AN]
how long do you plan to stay?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
I already know what you[N] 
are me to ask[AN]
as long as I stay here[N] 
I will help Nausica[aa] as best I can[AN]
[OpenRight]*coff* *coff*[AN]
thanks, really thanks[N]
my friend[AN]
you will be well paid for this job[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Don't worry about these[N]
nonsense, I don't want a coin from you[AN]
I would like a room instead[N]
for me and my nephew[AN]
and a good hot meal[AN]
[OpenRight]*coff* for you *coff*[N]
this and more! my old friend![AN]
Nausica[aa] do you agree with my idea?[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Yes father[AN]
[OpenRight]
I recommend you, my daughter, to follow[N]
Gillian's advice[AN]
he is a brave knight, with[N]
he and Kairs, you will be safe[AN]
*coff* *coff*[AN]
[OpenFarRight]My Lady I recommend you[N]

Elder, tell me[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm sorry ... your father[N]
does not do it out of malice[AN]
he just wants to protect you[N]
and your sister[AN]
... ... ...[AN]
why don't you tell him the[N]
truth: you are gone[AN]
to look for medicinal herbs[N]
to ease his pain[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You know how it is done...[AN]
he would get even more angry if[N]
he discovers that I risk my life for him[AN]
especially after all his[N]
defeatist speeches...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Maybe you are right...but[N]
I feel guilty for not having taken...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Elder, please, I don't try[N]
resentment towards anyone[AN]
you have helped me countless times[AN]
don't worry about these nonsense[AN]
Did you see Master Salem sooner?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Actually, it's been this morning[N]
that I don't see it[AN]
you have to try to ask[N]
to his apprentice[AN]
stands at the east intersection[AN]
he will probably know where[N]
it is found at[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you so much elder[AN]
[OpenMidRight]

[OpenMidLeft]
Lena? why are you crying?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Why did you run away! I had[N]
so afraid of losing you![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lena, I didn't run away, I was[N]
performing a task[AN]
I would be back as soon as I finished[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Don't tell lies![AN]
Dad hadn't given you any[N]
mission! you wanted to leave us![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Don't say this nonsense![AN]
I don't want to leave you or anyone[N]
of the valley[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I was so afraid, afraid of[N]
lose you forever...[AN]
since you go out alone, I had[N]
a nightmare[AN]
that you would never come back to us[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
It was just a bad dream Lena[AN]
I will always come back to you and[N] 
from Dad to help you[AN]
I promise that I will always remain close to you[AN]
you don't have to worry[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
*sniff*I trust you sister...[AN]
watch out for tomorrow's job[AN]
When you come back, you can read[N] 
me this new book?[AN]
The old librarian recommended it[AN]
he's really a weird man...[AN]
it's always in there ... among the books...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You can rest assured that[N]
I'll be back, and yes...[AN]
I read you this new book[AN]
just don't fall asleep[N]
to the first page[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Thank you so much big sister![AN]

## Ch0xTalk4part1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xCE][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x02][0x01][OpenMidLeft]
you, again? what do you want now?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You said people avoid[N] 
you because you were a thief[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
and continue to use i[N]
my old tricks[AN]
picking locks[AN]
see where others[N]
they don't see[AN]
I do the dirty work...[AN]
but someone has to do it[AN]
but I don't mind that much,[N]
my employer is an honest person[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You could use these "tricks"[N]
to help the people of Sorya[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
the Sorya's people are "honest"[AN]
who would ever need[N]
to make a thief do a job?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I know a person who[N]
needs your help[AN]
is located near the inn[N]
he's an old man...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
... ... ...[AN]
why on earth should I help[N]
someone who despises me?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I don't understand, you have it[N]
said yourself[AN]
you are no longer a thief[AN]
then why do you want to be[N]
considered for your past[AN]
knowing that you repudiate him[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
you haven't told me yet[N]
what's your name...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
The name of a thief[N]
does not count[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
for me matter[AN]
and will also count for[N]
the person you will help[AN]
how do you want to be remembered?[AN]
like a man you do[N]
he feels guilty for being a thief[AN]
or for the man, with a name[N]
who decided to face[AN]
worthy of one's life[AN]
this attitude of yours[AN]
in all honesty ... it sucks me[AN]
I understand, with you it is useless[N]
talk, I hope tomorrow[AN]
you know what you will face and[N]
that your fatalism[AN]
don't hinder our mission[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
... ... ...[AN]

Hey! there is no need[N] 
to be so grumpy![AN]
I know how to manage a battlefield![AN]
why are you so obnoxious?[AN]
I was just trying to make friends[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Because the world was[N]
kind with me?[AN]
I see no reason to be kind[AN]
people aren't ever been with me[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I believe it, with[N] 
this behavior![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
What arrogance...you think[N]

you learn and have to...steal...[AN]
kill if necessary...too[N]
otherwise you would starve...[AN]
survive ...like beasts...[AN]

I warn you that I hate any[N]
formalities, the battlefield[AN]
it is not a place[N]
for the weak of etiquette[AN]
you only find room for[N]
shout and scream![AN]
Ha ha ha ha[AN]

will save you[AN]
let's say it needs something[N]
"strong", to wake up[AN]
loves the scent of[N]

Oh here is the girl who[N] 
helped us with the demons![AN]
even more surprising is to discover[N]
which is also the princess of this[AN]
lovely city[AN]
another reason, to give[N] 
you a gift![AN]
here take it![AN]
is a book about martial arts![AN]
reading it will make you[N]
even stronger![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you so much for the[N]
gift but...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]No but![AN]
this is a gift that marks[N]
the friendship between my caravan[AN]
and the good people of this place![A][X]

Ah, princess![AN]
first a young man passed[N]
on your behalf[AN]
that helped me[N]
find the house key[AN]
for the truth he broke into the[N]
door lock[AN]
and took the key[AN]
he was very kind, not[N]
he asked for nothing in return[AN]
he just said I had to[N]
remember his name...[AN]
Colt, yes it was[N]
this is his name[A][X]

OH NO! No! no![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Sir, What happened?[N]
why are you desperate?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I lost it! I lost it![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
What have you lost?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
The house key![AN]
for the truth I think it is[N]
remained inside my house...[AN]
but now I'm locked out![AN]
I don't know how to do it![AN]
I should break through[N]
the leads?[AN]
I don't have the strength[AN]
pick the lock? none[N]
in this city knows how to do it![AN]
because we of Sorya are[N]
honest people![AN]
not "dirty" thieves![AN]
I don't know how[N]
to do...[A][X]

Princess! princess![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Yala? why are you screaming?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh princess I was like that[N]
worried about you![AN]
when I knew[N]
that you ran away...[AN]
I have done nothing but[N]
pray to the Goddess all day[AN]
asking for your return, unhurt![AN]
Princess *sniff* I was like that[N]
worried about you...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh Yala...[AN]
you have to stay[N]
longer calm[AN]
and you should think[N]
more to yourself[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
But princess...I have[N]
vowed to the Goddess[AN]
that I would have served until[N]
end of my days [AN]
the princess of the[N]
people of Sorya[AN]
my only task[N]
in my life[AN]
is to serve you[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
... ... ...[AN]
I admire your devotion[AN]
but ... if you say you really want[N]
serve me[AN]
then you have to think more[N]
to yourself[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
But...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
None but[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Then can I ask you[N]
a favor?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Sure Yala[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Allow me to accompany[N]
you tomorrow [AN]
Stand by your side[N]
it will make me quieter[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Yala, but you don't[N]
know fight...[AN]
it's dangerous out there[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
But you said that[N]
I have to think more about myself[AN]
help you and the guard[N]
it will make me happy[AN]
I can't fight, but[N]
like every priestess[AN]
I know the healing arts[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I don't know how to say no...[AN]
just try to be careful[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you so much princess![A][X]
