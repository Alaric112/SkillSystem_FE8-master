[OpenFarLeft]
if it weren't for Nausica[aa][N]
we would never get here[AN]
[OpenRight]
What happened?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
On the way to the city[AN]

we had little hope, we were[N]
lost in the forest[AN]

suddenly your daughter emerged from[N]
the foliage of the forest[AN]
mowed down our assailants and[N]
led us out of the forest[AN]

## Ch0xTalk4part1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadColt][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x02][0x01][OpenMidLeft]
you, again? what do you want now?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You said people avoid[N] 
you because you were a thief[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
and continue to use i[N]
my old tricks[AN]
picking locks[AN]
see where others[N]
they don't see[AN]
I do the dirty work...[AN]
but someone has to do it[AN]
but I don't mind that much,[N]
my employer is an honest person[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You could use these "tricks"[N]
to help the people of Sorya[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
the Sorya's people are "honest"[AN]
who would ever need[N]
to make a thief do a job?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I know a person who[N]
needs your help[AN]
is located near the inn[N]
he's an old man...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
... ... ...[AN]
why on earth should I help[N]
someone who despises me?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I don't understand, you have it[N]
said yourself[AN]
you are no longer a thief[AN]
then why do you want to be[N]
considered for your past[AN]
knowing that you repudiate him[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
you haven't told me yet[N]
what's your name...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
The name of a thief[N]
does not count[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
for me matter[AN]
and will also count for[N]
the person you will help[AN]
how do you want to be remembered?[AN]
like a man you do[N]
he feels guilty for being a thief[AN]
or for the man, with a name[N]
who decided to face[AN]
worthy of one's life[AN]
this attitude of yours[AN]
in all honesty ... it sucks me[AN]
I understand, with you it is useless[N]
talk, I hope tomorrow[AN]
you know what you will face and[N]
that your fatalism[AN]
don't hinder our mission[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]

Hey! there is no need[N] 
to be so grumpy![AN]
I know how to manage a battlefield![AN]
why are you so obnoxious?[AN]
I was just trying to make friends[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Because the world was[N]
kind with me?[AN]
I see no reason to be kind[AN]
people aren't ever been with me[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I believe it, with[N] 
this behavior![AN]

which is also the princess!
of this lovely city![AN]

you a gift![AN]

Ah, princess![AN]
first a young man passed[N]
on your behalf[AN]
that helped me[N]
find the house key[AN]
for the truth he broke into the[N]
door lock[AN]
and took the key[AN]
he was very kind, not[N]
he asked for nothing in return[AN]
he just said I had to[N]
remember his name...[AN]
Colt, yes it was[N]
this is his name[A][X]

OH NO! No! no![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Sir, What happened?[N]
why are you desperate?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I lost it! I lost it![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
What have you lost?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
The house key![AN]
for the truth I think it is[N]
remained inside my house...[AN]
but now I'm locked out![AN]
I don't know how to do it![AN]
I should break through[N]
the leads?[AN]
I don't have the strength[AN]
pick the lock? none[N]
in this city knows how to do it![AN]
because we of Sorya are[N]
honest people![AN]
not "dirty" thieves![AN]
I don't know how[N]
to do...[A][X]

Princess! princess![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Yala? why are you screaming?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
princess, I was so[N]
worried about you[AN]
when I knew[N]
that you ran away...[AN]
I prayed to the Goddess all[N]
day for your safe return[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh Yala...[AN]
you should be more calm[AN]
and you should think[N]
more to yourself...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
But princess...I have[N]
vowed to the Goddess[AN]
that I would have served until[N]
end of my days [AN]
the princess of the[N]
people of Sorya[AN]
my only task[N]
in my life[AN]
is to serve you[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
... ... ...[AN]
I admire your devotion[AN]
but...if you say you really want[N]
serve me[AN]
then you have to think more[N]
to yourself[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
But...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
None but[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Then can I ask you[N]
a favor?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Sure![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Allow me to accompany[N]
you tomorrow[AN]
Stand by your side It would[N]
make me feel better[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Yala, but you don't[N]
know fight...[AN]
it's dangerous...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
But you said that[N]
I have to think more about myself[AN]
help you and the guard[N]
it will make me happy[AN]
I can't fight, but[N]
like every priestess[AN]
I know the healing arts[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I don't know how to say no...[AN]
just try to be careful[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you princess![AN]
You can rest easy, I won't[N]
make you regret[A][X]
