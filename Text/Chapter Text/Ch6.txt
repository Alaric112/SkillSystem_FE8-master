W-What? where am I...[AN]
Ahh...what a pain in the head...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hey! welcome back to the real world![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I know, I know...[AN]
I'm sorry I got you involved in matters[N]
between the Empire and Alistar[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
A bandage? I didn't remember having[N]
one...was it you who made it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Um...yes, you had a wounded arm[AN]
it was better to keep[N]
him from infection[AN]
in a demonic forest even the[N]
air carries disease...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Thanks for your help[AN]
But Why don't you think[N]
I'm an Imperial?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
First of all from your clothes they[N]
remind me of the Worm Handlers[AN]
but, I think I've never[N]
seen a similar style[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I understand...but I don't think it[N]
was enough to convince you...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Sure! you are much prettier than[N]
the imperial snake![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh come on! don't look at me like[N]
that! it was just a compliment[AN]
I mean it seriously[AN] 
there are now few people who avoid[N]
shedding blood unnecessarily...[AN]
therefore, I had to[N]
somehow help you...[AN]
for this damned war I lost my city...[N]
and now my sister too...[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]
*frush* *frush*[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
A squirrel fox?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh, it looks like our friend is back[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Do you have a squirrel fox?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
No, I thought it was yours...[AN]
when I found you it was[N]
already there...[AN]
it looks like a guard dog[N]
watching its owner...[AN]
it took a long time to gain his trust[AN]
[OpenMidRight]

## Text2Ch6
I have never seen a squirrel fox[N]
behave like that![AN]
it seems that he likes you...[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadAsbel][OpenMidRight][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidLeft]
Really amazing! they are normally[N]
very aggressive towards humans![AN]
especially to think that we have been[N]
stuck here for a whole day...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Wait up! have we been here for a day?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I've seen the sun go down and rise[AN]
we have already been lucky that[N]
the trees of the forest[AN]
saved us during the crash...[AN]
besides we are in a demonic forest...[AN]
and no demon has come near us...[N]
except for this little one...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I can't believe I've been[N]
unconscious all this time[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh, you don't have to worry...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
No! you don't understand[AN] 
my people are in danger, I absolutely[N]
have to go back![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Forgive me for raising my voice...[N]
I don't know what came over me...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
don't worry, I know this[N]
anger too well[AN]
the imperials took my city[N]
too long ago[AN]
It seems we have a common[N]
enemy, let me help you[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I do not seek revenge, I just[N]
want to save my people[AN]
if there is a peaceful[N]
way to do it...[AN]
I will follow it, even at the[N]
cost of my life[AN]
for this I have to find Princess Kushana[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hang on! I hope you're joking![AN]
that woman is the armed wing[N]
of the imperial army![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
With his help, however, I can save my[N]
people, and avoid further conflicts[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I admit that you're really specia...l[AN]
you are the first person I have met[N]
who befriends a squirrel fox[AN]
and who tries to dialogue[N]
with the Imperials[AN]
Not having much chance at the[N]
moment, I will help you[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Thank you, Asbel, I haven't[N]
introduced myself yet[AN]
I'm Nausica[aa] from the valley[N]
of the wind[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Look, even the little one seems[N]
to want to help you![AN]
[ToggleSmile]
he doesn't seem to want to leave[N]
you, you should give him a name[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Teto, this is his name[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
having said that ... how do[N]
you plan to move?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
We continue along the river, and[N]
look for other survivors[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Are you familiar with these lands?[AN]
The forest is agitated...[AN]
if we are not careful we will end[N]
up with a pack of demons...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
don't worry, I've been through[N]
these woods many times[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Very well, then lead the way![A][X]
