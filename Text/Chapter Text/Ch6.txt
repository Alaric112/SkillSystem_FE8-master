W-What? where am I...[AN]
Ahh...what a pain in the head...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hey! welcome back to the real world![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I know, I know...[AN]
I'm sorry I got you involved in matters[N]
between the Empire and Alistar[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
A bandage? I didn't remember having[N]
one...was it you who made it?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Um...yes, you had a wounded arm[AN]
it was better to keep[N]
him from infection[AN]
in a demonic forest even the[N]
air carries disease...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Thanks for your help[AN]
But Why don't you think[N]
I'm an Imperial?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
First of all from your clothes they[N]
remind me of the Worm Handlers[AN]
but, I think I've never[N]
seen a similar style[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I understand...but I don't think it[N]
was enough to convince you...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Sure! you are much prettier than[N]
the imperial snake![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh come on! don't look at me like[N]
that! it was just a compliment[AN]
I mean it seriously[AN] 
there are now few people who avoid[N]
shedding blood unnecessarily...[AN]
therefore, I had to[N]
somehow help you...[AN]
for this damned war I lost my city...[N]
and now my sister too...[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]
*frush* *frush*[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
A squirrel fox?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh, it looks like our friend is back[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Do you have a squirrel fox?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
No, I thought it was yours...[AN]
when I found you it was[N]
already there...[AN]
it looks like a guard dog[N]
watching its owner...[AN]
it took a long time to gain his trust[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
*!!!*[A][X]

## Text2Ch6
I have never seen a squirrel fox[N]
behave like that![AN]
it seems that he likes you...[A][X]

## Text3Ch6
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAsbel][OpenMidRight][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidLeft]
Really amazing! they are normally[N]
very aggressive towards humans![AN]
especially to think that we have been[N]
stuck here for a whole day...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Wait up! have we been here for a day?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I've seen the sun go down and rise[AN]
we have already been lucky that[N]
the trees of the forest[AN]
saved us during the crash...[AN]
besides we are in a demonic forest...[AN]
and no demon has come near us...[N]
except for this little one...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I can't believe I've been[N]
unconscious all this time[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh, you don't have to worry...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
No! you don't understand[AN] 
my people are in danger, I absolutely[N]
have to go back![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Forgive me for raising my voice...[N]
I don't know what came over me...[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
don't worry, I know this[N]
anger too well[AN]
the imperials took my city[N]
too long ago[AN]
It seems we have a common[N]
enemy, let me help you[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I do not seek revenge, I just[N]
want to save my people[AN]
if there is a peaceful[N]
way to do it...[AN]
I will follow it, even at the[N]
cost of my life[AN]
for this I have to find Princess Kushana[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hang on! I hope you're joking![AN]
that woman is the armed wing[N]
of the imperial army![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
With his help, however, I can save my[N]
people, and avoid further conflicts[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I admit that you're really specia...l[AN]
you are the first person I have met[N]
who befriends a squirrel fox[AN]
and who tries to dialogue[N]
with the Imperials[AN]
Not having much chance at the[N]
moment, I will help you[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Thank you, Asbel, I haven't[N]
introduced myself yet[AN]
I'm Nausica[aa] from the valley[N]
of the wind[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Look, even the little one seems[N]
to want to help you![AN]
[ToggleSmile]
he doesn't seem to want to leave[N]
you, you should give him a name[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Teto, this is his name[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
having said that ... how do[N]
you plan to move?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
We continue along the river, and[N]
look for other survivors[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Are you familiar with these lands?[AN]
The forest is agitated...[AN]
if we are not careful we will end[N]
up with a pack of demons...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
don't worry, I've been through[N]
these woods many times[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Very well, then lead the way![A][X]

## Text4Ch6
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSlayder][OpenMidRight][LoadMistero][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, my friend![AN]
then, news?[AN]
Was Princess Kushana the victim[N]
of an unfortunate accident?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
The Princess Ship has[N]
crashed as planned[AN]
and General Zechiel is busy[N]
with my friends[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Perfect![A]
Now, the whole region is[N]
under my control![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
We haven't won yet[AN]
the princess is still alive...[AN]
moreover the local population[N]
is in turmoil[AN]
an old knight formed a[N]
passive resistance[AN]
and he is organizing a counter-attack[N]
I feel it...[AN]
if we do not intervene quickly we risk[N]
that our enemy can join forces[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Damn, but I know the right[N]
men for this job[AN]
eliminating Kushana will[N]
not be difficult...[AN]
I worry about how to stop[N]
these peasants...[AN]
I would like to avoid further[N]
inflicting them...[AN]
in the end our real enemy[N]
is Princess Kushana[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
General, a much greater darkness[N]
presides over these lands...[AN]
We must act quickly the heir of these[N]
lands will soon come forward...[AN]
could be our emperor's[N]
greatest threat![A][X]

## Text5Ch6
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBeran][OpenMidRight][LoadKushana][OpenMidLeft]
Princess Kushana![AN]
are you all right your highness?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thanks to the Goddess, help[N]
is finally arrived...[AN]
Soldier, which company do[N]
you belong to?[AN]
General Slayder sent us when he heard[N]
about the airship crash[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
General Zechiel I guess is with you[N]
I must immediately speak to her[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Unfortunately we found the body of[N]
the lifeless general...[AN]
I'm really sorry your highness[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN][OpenEyes]
have you found any other survivors?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
No, you are the only one...[AN]
we have to get out of here soon[N]
the demons will come...[AN] 
come with us we will make your[N]
way to this filthy jungle...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
For being an assasin you are[N]
really terrible...[A][X]

## Text6Ch6
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBeran][OpenMidRight][LoadKushana][OpenMidLeft]
What!?! Did you hit your[N]
head my princess?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Unfortunately for you, no![AN]
Zechiel was not on board the ship![AN]
it's impossible that you have[N]
found her body![AN]
That bastard, Slayder is a traitor![AN]
and he now he sent you to[N]
finish the job![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
... ... ...[AN]
[OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]
You are right...I'm not[N]
a good liar but...[A][X]

## Text7Ch6
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBeran][OpenMidRight][LoadKushana][OpenMidRight]
[CloseEyes]
*Urgh...Damn worm...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
really impressive![AN]
no one survives my arrows![AN]
Oh well the second hit will[N]
finish the job...[A][X]

## Text8Ch6
[OpenFarLeft][LoadAsbel][OpenLeft][LoadNausicaa][OpenRight][LoadBeran][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x6D][0x1][OpenLeft]
Leave her immediately![AN]
or you'll have to face[N]
me in battle![AN]
[OpenRight]
Eh!?! and where do these[N]
two come from![AN]
but if you insist on wanting[N]
to die...[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Boss! the demons are approaching![AN]
if it's not there we go immediately[N]
we will be surrounded![AN]
[OpenRight]
Oh...it means they'll[N]
finish the job[AN]
come on guys it's time to[N]
cut the rope![A][X]

## Text9Ch6
[OpenFarLeft][LoadAsbel][OpenLeft][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidRight][LoadKushana][OpenMidRight]
Nausica[aa]...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Curse! we are completely surrounded![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Well...we can always leave the[N]
imperial snake![AN]
she would be an excellent[N]
bait for the demons[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Nausica[aa], what are you doing with[N]
this dog from Alistar[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Look who's talking![AN]
[OpenLeft]
Hey! Cut it out, you two![AN]
don't you understand that[N]
we have a common goal?[AN]
if we work together we can[N]
get out alive![AN]
but if you want to continue[N]
insulting[AN]
while a pack of demons[N]
is chasing us...[AN]
go ahead...[AN]
but I don't stay here[N]
waiting for my end[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
... ... ...[AN]
I told you Nausica[aa]...[AN]
it is clear that you are[N]
not an imperial[AN]
my sword is with you![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
It seems that I have no[N]
other option...[AN]
You are a very interesting[N]
person Nausica[aa]...[AN]
I'm with you[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Well, let's stick together[AN]
let's watch our backs[N]
for each other[AN]
only in this way will we survive![A][X]

## Text10Ch6
[OpenFarLeft][LoadAsbel][OpenLeft][LoadNausicaa][OpenMidRight][LoadKushana][OpenLeft]
Teto? what are you doing?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Do you now also have a pet? How many[N]
other surprises do you have?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Even the little one seems to want[N]
to give us a hand![AN]
[OpenLeft]
Teto, stay close to me![AN]
don't go away, we don't know[N]
what we have to face[A][X]

## MidText1Ch6
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHarken][OpenRight][LoadCatherina][OpenFarRight][LoadArthur][OpenMidLeft]
My lady...are you sure[AN]
[OpenRight]
Yes, Harken[AN]
Nausica[aa] saved us, it's time[N]
to return the favor[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
You don't have to fear Harken[AN]
now that our team is assembled[N]
lady Catherina is safe[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadPriscilla][OpenLeft][LoadHarken]
[OpenFarLeft]
Ah!!![AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Oh...here's priscilla...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Forgive me Sir Harken[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Oh it's nothing the blow could[N]
have been worse[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Excuse me, but I think I found the[N]
person you were looking for[AN]
this Nausica[aa] is on the other[N]
side of the river...[AN]
and is at the side of the Imperial[N]
Princess and also of...Asbel...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Asbel? what is he doing here?[AN]
and that idiot, Gervaso didn't[N]
tell us anything...[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
I don't understand how he received[N]
the command of the operations...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
it was fortunate that the[N]
duke sent you too[AN]
that Gervaso...is just a[N]
good-for-nothing...[AN]
[OpenRight]
Harken, Arthur, now stop talking bad[N]
about others[AN]
we have more important things to do[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
You are right my lady[AN]
but there are still some[N]
unanswered questions...[AN]
the entire senate will have to[N]
respond to what happened...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Not to interrupt, but there are some[N]
strange people coming up against us...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Imperial pigs?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
I don't know...[AN]
but they attacked Nausica[aa][N]
and the Imperial princess[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Common Enemies...[N]
better be ready[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Arthur is right![AN]
stay behind my shield![A][X]

## MidText3Ch6
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x6D][0x1][OpenMidLeft][LoadBeran][OpenMidRight]
Boss! a group of people is going[N]
to rescue our prey![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
What!?! don't let them interfere with[N]
our operations! eliminate them all![A][X]
 
## MidText4Ch6
Lead Nausica[aa] and Kushana to[N]
the designated places[A][X]

## MidText5Ch6

troublemakers![A][X]

## EndText1Ch6
[OpenFarLeft][LoadKushana][OpenLeft][LoadNausicaa][OpenRight][LoadCatherina][OpenFarRight][LoadHarken][OpenRight]
Nausica[aa]! thanks to the Goddess[N]
you are safe![AN]
[OpenLeft]
Catherina![AN]
I didn't think I'd meet[N]
you like this[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Why are you together with[N]
the Imperial Princess![AN]
you should have let her die...[AN]
it would have been a just[N]
payment for her crimes![AN]
[OpenLeft]
Death cannot absolve a[N]
person's crimes![AN]
only his future actions[N]
will decide this[AN]
everyone deserves to be able[N]
to remedy his mistakes![AN]
[OpenFarRight]
You can think of it as you want...[AN]
the fact remains that she[N]
will have to die[AN]
if necessary, by my hand![AN]
I will finally give justice to[N]
the tormented souls of pejite![AN]
[OpenLeft]
Then you'll have to[N]
face me first![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
*!!!*[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Well, so it is decided![AN]
[OpenRight]
Harken is enough![AN]
[OpenFarRight]
But mylady...[AN]
[OpenRight]
Catherina di Alistar...[AN]
I know your family, the Mani...[AN]
your father...is one of the most[N]
influential senators in the republic...[AN]
why are you here?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Why?[AN]
don't you even know that your[N]
forces had captured us?[AN]
while we were in the neutral[N]
region of Laurentia![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
The Laurentia region does not seem to[N]
me to be the territory of Alistar[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
But not even Imperial![AN]
you had no right to invade it![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha [A]
there are clear and[N]
precise treatises![AN]
Knights of Alistar I advise you to[N]
study them better before speaking[AN]
however, does this mean that you[N]
were caught by mistake?[AN][ToggleSmile]
you Alistars are ridiculous[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Now that's enough![AN]
I don't care about your[N]
political games[AN]
May I know who those men were[N]
who tried to kill us?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Wormhandlers...sent by General Slayder[N]
for the purpose of killing me...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Why general slayder has sent a bunch[N]
of assasin to kill you?[AN]
[OpenRight]
Wormhandlers...why are those savages[N]
here? for what purpose?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
I don't have a precise answer...[AN]
but I start to think that all these[N]
random events are not at all[AN]
first the capture of Catherina...[AN]
then a strange incident that[N]
hits a transport airship[AN]
which is taken as a declaration[N]
of war...[AN]
then multiple attempts to[N]
try to kill me...[AN]
[OpenRight][LoadAsbel][OpenRight]
wait up...[AN]
Our team had received[N]
the order...[A]
to shoot down the[N]
first airship...[A]
the commander made us place[N]
markers to attract demons[AN]
to eliminate the enemy airship...[AN]
but I swear, we didn't know[N]
of your presence on board![AN]
[OpenFarRight]
What?!?[AN]
I can't believe it[AN]
[OpenRight]
We had received the information that[N]
it was an Imperial warship![A]
carrying supplies to[N]
the new fortress[AN]
was informations received from[N]
a "reliable" source[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
And instead it was just a[N]
transport ship[AN]
a ship that had to[N]
act covertly[AN]
to bring the prisoners[N]
back to Alistar[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
What are you talking about?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
That ship was headed for Alistar...[AN]
it should have brought you home...[AN]
I myself organized the mission...[AN]
[OpenFarRight][LoadCatherina][OpenFarRight]
If what you are saying is true...[N]
it means we have a common enemy...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Who can benefit from all of this?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
That worm, Slayder...[AN]
I can't think that he has organized a[N]
conspiracy so accurate in every detail...[AN]
yet he has failed for only one[N]
particular...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
and what would it be?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
You, with your people...[AN]
you should have died...[AN]
instead, having surrendered, he was[N]
forced to stop operations...[AN]
but now that I'm out[N]
of the games...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
No ... oh no! my people are in[N]
danger, I have to move![AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Nausica[aa], you saved my life[AN]
I will help you save your people[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Interesting ... very interesting...[AN]
Nausicaa, you seems like the one that[N]
will connect our two opposite nations[AN]
I promise you that worm will[N]
pay for his crimes[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Thank you for your support[AN]
we must go to Mount Satoru as soon[N]
as possible, follow me![A][X]

Asbel![AN]
[OpenRight]
I am happy to see the old[N]
team reassembled[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Asbel, why did you decide to[N]
go with that fool of Gervaso?[AN]
[OpenRight]
After the bankruptcy in Pejite...[AN]
the senator, "advised" me to leave[N]
the team, and not to return[A]
[OpenLeft]
practically has put all the blame[N]
on you...what a miserable man...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
But...but you too are[N]
one of the sons...[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Asbel... forgive me for failing...[AN]
[OpenRight]
Don't worry, Senator Adrian[N]
helped me after that.[AN]
that's why I found myself working[N]
with commander Gervaso[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Come on, such behavior is't normal![AN]
that incapable fool! he only works[N]
to save his image![AN]
but never does something[N]
good for others...[AN]
[OpenRight]
I'm not saying it didn't hurt...[AN]
but for the sake of Pejite[N]
and my sister...[AN]
[OpenLeft]
your deeds are commendable Asbel,[N]
no one would do it[AN]
[OpenRight]
Come on! now you almost[N]
make me a hero![AN]
I only decided to think of the[N]
best for everyone[A]
oh come on! we remained[N]
too far behind[AN]
[OpenRight][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft]
Good for everyone except him...[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
Poor boy...[AN]
I can't think that Catherina's[N]
father...[AN]
I better stop talking...[N]
Harken, I'm sorry...[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Priscilla is right...[AN]
Harken you...[AN]
I beg your pardon...we[N]
weren't there with you[AN]
we think that now we[N]
are united again...[AN]

it seems that at the moment[AN]
they can't help us anymore[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Useless dogs...they just gave trouble[N]
instead of helping us![AN]
